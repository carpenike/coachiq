# Feature Manager Safety Implementation - Completion Plan

## Executive Summary

This plan outlines the remaining work to complete the Feature Manager Safety implementation for **RV deployment on Raspberry Pi with <5 users**. Moving from 85% → 100% completion with a focus on practical safety needs versus enterprise complexity. The priority is ensuring physical safety (slides, awnings, leveling jacks) while being resource-efficient for single-RV deployment.

## Current Status (January 13, 2025)

**Completion: 85%**
- ✅ Core safety patterns implemented
- ✅ Safety classification system operational
- ✅ Feature state machine with validation
- ✅ Safety service with interlocks and emergency stop
- ✅ Basic authentication system for web/API access
- ⚠️ SafetyService not integrated into main application
- ❌ Essential safety testing missing
- ❌ PIN-based safety authorization incomplete (needed for internet connectivity)
