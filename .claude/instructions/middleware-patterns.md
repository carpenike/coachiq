# Middleware Architecture Patterns

## üèóÔ∏è Edge Layer vs Application Layer Separation

**CRITICAL**: This RV-C vehicle control system uses a split middleware architecture for optimal performance, security, and maintainability.

### Architectural Principle: Context Awareness

**Edge Layer (Caddy)**: Handles tasks that are *application-agnostic* - operates on raw HTTP requests, connections, and IPs without understanding business logic.

**Application Layer (FastAPI)**: Handles tasks that are *context-aware* - understands users, permissions, application state, and RV-C command semantics.

## Current Middleware Distribution

### ‚úÖ Moved to Caddy Edge Layer

#### 1. CORS Handling
```caddyfile
# Caddy handles CORS more efficiently than FastAPI
@options method OPTIONS
header @options {
    Access-Control-Allow-Origin "*"
    Access-Control-Allow-Methods "GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS"
    Access-Control-Allow-Headers "Accept, Accept-Language, Content-Language, Content-Type, Authorization, X-Requested-With, Cache-Control"
    Access-Control-Allow-Credentials "true"
}
respond @options 204
```

**Why Caddy**: Pure transport-level concern, no business logic required.

#### 2. Request ID Generation
```caddyfile
# Caddy generates UUID-based request IDs for tracing
reverse_proxy localhost:8000 {
    header_up X-Request-ID {http.request.uuid}
}
```

**Why Caddy**: Edge-layer tracing, consistent across all requests, better performance.

#### 3. IP-based Rate Limiting
```caddyfile
# First line of defense - IP-based limits
rate_limit {
    zone auth {
        key {http.request.remote.host}
        window 1m
        events 5  # 5 auth attempts per minute per IP
    }
}
```

**Why Caddy**: No application context needed, protects Python from DoS attacks.

#### 4. Response Compression
```caddyfile
# More efficient than Python-level compression
encode {
    gzip
}
```

**Why Caddy**: Better performance, offloads CPU-intensive work from Python.

#### 5. DDoS Protection
- **Handled by**: Caddy rate limiting zones
- **Replaced**: NetworkSecurityMiddleware (removed entirely)
- **Benefit**: Better performance, architectural clarity

### ‚úÖ Remains in FastAPI Application Layer

#### 1. Authentication Middleware
```python
# Context-aware authentication with business logic
class AuthenticationMiddleware:
    async def dispatch(self, request: Request, call_next):
        # JWT validation, user context, session management
        # MUST remain in FastAPI for security context
```

**Why FastAPI**: Requires user context, business logic, ServiceRegistry integration.

#### 2. Runtime Validation Middleware
```python
# Safety-critical validation for RV-C commands
class RuntimeValidationMiddleware:
    async def dispatch(self, request: Request, call_next):
        # Pydantic schema validation for vehicle control
        # Type safety enforcement for safety-critical operations
```

**Why FastAPI**: Understands RV-C protocol semantics, safety-critical validation.

#### 3. User-aware Rate Limiting
```python
# SlowAPI with user/session context
from backend.middleware.rate_limiting import auth_limiter

@auth_rate_limit
async def login_endpoint():
    # Per-user, per-username rate limiting
    # Business logic dependent
```

**Why FastAPI**: Requires user context, safety-critical operation limits.

#### 4. Performance Middleware
```python
# Application-specific metrics and tracing
class PerformanceMiddleware:
    async def __call__(self, scope, receive, send):
        # Consumes X-Request-ID from Caddy or generates fallback
        # Application-level performance metrics
```

**Why FastAPI**: Application-specific metrics, request context propagation.

#### 5. Audit Context Middleware
```python
# User-aware audit logging
class AuditContextMiddleware:
    async def dispatch(self, request: Request, call_next):
        # User tracking, distributed tracing, compliance logging
```

**Why FastAPI**: Requires authenticated user context, business logic.

#### 6. Secure Authentication Middleware
```python
# Complex authentication flows
class SecureAuthenticationMiddleware:
    async def dispatch(self, request: Request, call_next):
        # HttpOnly cookies, token refresh, safety-critical endpoint protection
```

**Why FastAPI**: Complex business logic, ServiceRegistry integration.

## Migration Guidelines

### When to Move to Caddy
1. **Transport-level concerns** - No business logic required
2. **Performance critical** - CPU-intensive operations (compression, static files)
3. **First line of defense** - IP-based protection before hitting Python
4. **Application-agnostic** - Works the same regardless of application logic

### When to Keep in FastAPI
1. **Context-aware** - Requires user, session, or business context
2. **Safety-critical** - RV-C vehicle control validation
3. **ServiceRegistry dependent** - Needs access to application services
4. **Complex business logic** - Multi-step validation, state management

### Decision Tree
```
Is this middleware safety-critical for vehicle control?
‚îú‚îÄ YES ‚Üí Keep in FastAPI (MANDATORY)
‚îî‚îÄ NO ‚Üí Does it require user/business context?
    ‚îú‚îÄ YES ‚Üí Keep in FastAPI
    ‚îî‚îÄ NO ‚Üí Does it improve performance if moved to edge?
        ‚îú‚îÄ YES ‚Üí Move to Caddy
        ‚îî‚îÄ NO ‚Üí Evaluate based on architectural clarity
```

## Development vs Production

### Development Mode (FastAPI only)
- **CORS**: Handled by FastAPI fallback (middleware detects missing Caddy headers)
- **Request ID**: Generated locally if X-Request-ID header not present
- **Rate Limiting**: Full SlowAPI rate limiting active
- **Compression**: Handled by FastAPI if enabled

### Production Mode (Caddy + FastAPI)
- **CORS**: Handled by Caddy (FastAPI middleware disabled)
- **Request ID**: Generated by Caddy, consumed by FastAPI
- **Rate Limiting**: Split between Caddy (IP-based) and FastAPI (user-aware)
- **Compression**: Handled by Caddy

## Configuration Patterns

### Caddy Configuration
```caddyfile
# Always document the middleware separation strategy
# MIDDLEWARE SEPARATION STRATEGY:
# - CORS handling: Moved from FastAPI to Caddy (better performance)
# - Request ID generation: Moved from FastAPI to Caddy (edge-layer tracing)
# - Rate limiting: SPLIT ARCHITECTURE
#   * Caddy (IP-based): First line of defense
#   * FastAPI (User-aware): Context-aware limits for safety-critical ops
```

### FastAPI Configuration
```python
# Document what was moved to Caddy
# CORS handling moved to Caddy edge layer - see config/Caddyfile.example

# Update middleware to consume Caddy headers
# Extract request ID from Caddy or generate fallback for development
headers = Headers(scope=scope)
request_id = headers.get("X-Request-ID") or generate_request_id()
```

### SecurityConfigService Integration
```python
async def get_caddy_rate_limits(self) -> dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Get rate limit configuration for Caddy edge layer.

    These are IP-based limits that should be configured in Caddyfile.
    The FastAPI application handles user-aware limits separately.
    """
    # Return Caddy-compatible configuration
```

## Testing Considerations

### Development Testing
- **Ensure fallbacks work**: Test FastAPI without Caddy headers
- **Verify middleware order**: Ensure proper initialization sequence
- **Test rate limiting**: Verify both IP-based and user-aware limits

### Production Testing
- **End-to-end tracing**: Verify request IDs flow from Caddy through FastAPI
- **Rate limit coordination**: Test that Caddy + FastAPI limits work together
- **Performance validation**: Measure improvement from edge-layer processing

## Common Pitfalls

### ‚ùå Don't Do This
```python
# Don't hardcode assumptions about Caddy presence
if caddy_header_present:
    use_caddy_flow()
else:
    use_fastapi_flow()  # WRONG - creates brittle code
```

### ‚úÖ Do This
```python
# Graceful fallback pattern
request_id = headers.get("X-Request-ID") or generate_request_id()
# Works in both development and production
```

### ‚ùå Don't Duplicate Logic
```python
# Don't implement the same rate limiting in both layers
caddy_rate_limit = True
fastapi_rate_limit = True  # REDUNDANT
```

### ‚úÖ Split Responsibilities
```python
# Clear separation of concerns
# Caddy: IP-based rate limiting (transport layer)
# FastAPI: User-aware rate limiting (application layer)
```

## Security Implications

### Trust Boundary
- **Trust boundary**: Network interface of FastAPI container
- **Never blindly trust**: Caddy headers without validation (except informational ones)
- **Always verify**: Security-relevant headers like Authorization

### Attack Surface Reduction
- **Caddy shields FastAPI**: From transport-level attacks
- **FastAPI focuses**: On business logic security
- **Defense in depth**: Multiple layers of protection

## Monitoring and Observability

### Caddy Metrics
- **Transport-level**: Request counts, response codes, TLS handshake stats
- **Rate limiting**: IP-based rate limit violations
- **Performance**: Total request duration including network latency

### FastAPI Metrics
- **Business-level**: `rvc_commands_executed`, `active_websockets`
- **Application processing**: Time spent in Python excluding network
- **User context**: Authentication success/failure, user-specific metrics

This architecture provides optimal separation of concerns while maintaining safety-critical validation where it belongs - in the application layer with full business context.
