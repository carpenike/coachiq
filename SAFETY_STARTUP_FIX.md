# Safety Service Startup Fix

## Issue Summary

The SafetyService was triggering an emergency stop immediately at server startup due to uninitialized system state causing safety interlock violations.

## Root Cause

1. **Empty System State**: The SafetyService initialized with an empty `_system_state` dictionary
2. **Default Interlock Conditions**: Three safety interlocks required `parking_brake_engaged`:
   - `slide_room_safety`
   - `awning_safety`
   - `leveling_jack_safety`
3. **Missing State Values**: When checking conditions, missing values defaulted to `False` (e.g., parking brake not engaged)
4. **Multiple Violations**: All three interlocks failed simultaneously, triggering emergency stop (threshold = 3)

## Solution Implemented

Initialize the system state with safe defaults representing a parked and stabilized RV:

```python
self._system_state: dict[str, Any] = {
    "vehicle_speed": 0.0,           # Vehicle not moving
    "parking_brake": True,           # Parking brake engaged
    "leveling_jacks_down": True,     # Jacks deployed for stability
    "engine_running": False,         # Engine off
    "transmission_gear": "PARK",     # Transmission in park
    "all_slides_retracted": True,    # All slides in safe position
}
```

## Changes Made

1. **SafetyService Initialization** (`backend/services/safety_service.py`):
   - Added default system state values in `__init__`
   - Added logging to show initial state
   - Updated docstring to document the behavior

2. **System State Update Method**:
   - Added documentation about key state values
   - Noted that updates should maintain safety consistency

3. **Test Coverage** (`tests/services/test_safety_service_basic.py`):
   - Added test to verify safe initialization state
   - Added test to confirm no emergency stop at startup

## Impact

- Server now starts successfully without false safety violations
- Safety interlocks remain active and functional
- System state can be updated via API as entities report their actual status
- Maintains safety-first approach while preventing false positives

## Future Considerations

1. Consider adding a grace period after startup before enforcing interlocks
2. Implement entity-based state synchronization to update system state from actual device values
3. Add configuration options for default state values per deployment
