## Using These Prompts

These prompt templates can be used in several ways:

1. **Direct Copy/Paste**: Copy the content of a prompt and paste it into a conversation with GitHub Copilot Chat or another AI assistant.

2. **Reference in Issues/PRs**: Link to these prompts in GitHub issues or pull requests to provide context for discussions.

3. **Customization**: Create a copy of a relevant prompt and customize it for your specific needs before using it.

## Workflow Example

Here's an example workflow using these prompts:

1. **Research**: Use the **Protocol Research Guide** to understand the Victron VE.Direct protocol.
   ```
   @copilot I need to research the Victron VE.Direct protocol. Let's use the Protocol Research Guide.
   ```

2. **Plan**: Use the **New Service Specification** template to define a VE.Direct integration service.
   ```
   @copilot I want to plan a new service for Victron VE.Direct integration. Let's use the New Service Specification template.
   ```

3. **Design**: Use the **Architectural Decision Guide** to decide on the integration approach.
   ```
   @copilot I need to decide on the architecture for VE.Direct integration. Let's use the Architectural Decision Guide.
   ```

4. **Implement**: Use the **Feature Implementation Guide** to implement the service.
   ```
   @copilot I'm ready to implement the VE.Direct service based on our spec in /docs/specs/victron-direct-service.md. Let's use the Feature Implementation Guide.
   ```

5. **Document**: Use the **Service Documentation Template** to document the new service.
   ```
   @copilot Now that the VE.Direct service is implemented, let's document it with the Service Documentation Template.
   ```

## MCP Tools Integration

These prompts work well with the MCP tools defined in the project:

- Use `@context7` with these prompts to get project-specific recommendations based on the current codebase.
  - *Example*: `@context7 Show me how WebSocket connections are currently implemented` will help when designing new WebSocket features.

- Use `@perplexity` for researching external protocols or libraries mentioned in your planning.
  - *Example*: `@perplexity What is the message format for Victron VE.Direct protocol?` will provide external knowledge.

- Use `@github` to find related issues or PRs while planning new features.
  - *Example*: `@github Search for issues related to tank monitoring` will find existing discussions on the topic.

## Planning to Implementation Flow

The prompts are designed to support a complete development workflow:

1. **Planning prompts** generate comprehensive specifications saved to `/docs/specs/<feature-name>.md`
2. **Implementation prompts** reference these specs for structured implementation
3. **Documentation prompts** ensure the feature is well-documented for future reference

This flow ensures consistent quality and maintainability throughout the development process.

## Prompt Relationships and Output Locations

The prompts follow consistent naming patterns for output files in the `/docs/specs/` directory:

| Prompt Template | Output Location |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| feature-planning.md | `/docs/specs/<feature-name>.md` |
| new-service-spec.md | `/docs/specs/<service-name>.md` |
| architectural-decision.md | `/docs/specs/adr-<decision-topic>.md` |
| code-refactoring.md | `/docs/specs/refactor-<topic>.md` |
| rvc-integration.md | `/docs/specs/rvc-dgn-<dgn_number>.md` |
| react-ui-prototype.md | `/docs/specs/react-<component-name>.md` |

### Differences Between Similar Prompts

- **Feature Planning vs. New Service Spec**:
  - *Feature Planning* focuses on breaking down an entire feature across multiple system components
  - *New Service Spec* focuses on a single service and its detailed internal design

- **Feature Planning vs. RV-C Integration**:
  - *Feature Planning* is general-purpose for any feature
  - *RV-C Integration* is specialized for protocol-specific DGN implementations with byte-level details

- **Architectural Decision vs. Code Refactoring**:
  - *Architectural Decision* focuses on making and documenting high-level design choices
  - *Code Refactoring* focuses on restructuring existing code with minimal functional changes

## Prompt YAML Front Matter

All prompt files include standardized front matter headers to provide metadata and enable special functionality:

```yaml
---
mode: 'agent'  # Indicates this is an interactive agent prompt
description: 'Brief description of what the prompt does'
tools: ['context7', 'perplexity_ask']  # Required tools for this prompt
---
```

### Front Matter Fields

- **mode**: Either 'agent' for interactive prompts or 'static' for reference files
- **description**: Brief summary of the prompt's purpose
- **tools**: List of MCP tools required for the prompt to function properly

### Using Context7 for Validation

Most planning prompts now include specific guidance to use `@context7` to validate approaches:

1. **Before specifying implementation details**:
   ```
   @context7 How are API endpoints structured in the current codebase?
   ```

2. **When choosing design patterns**:
   ```
   @context7 What patterns are used for WebSocket event handling?
   ```

3. **When integrating with existing components**:
   ```
   @context7 Show me how the state management system currently works
   ```

Always check existing code patterns using `@context7` before finalizing design decisions to maintain consistency across the codebase.
