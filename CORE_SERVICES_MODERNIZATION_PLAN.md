# Core Services Modernization Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the plan to modernize the CoachIQ RV-C control system by separating mandatory infrastructure services from optional features. The current architecture allows critical services like persistence to be disabled via configuration, which poses risks for a safety-critical vehicle control system.

**Goal**: Implement a lightweight Core Service Layer pattern that guarantees mandatory services are always available, while keeping the implementation simple and resource-efficient for Raspberry Pi deployment.

**Target Environment**:
- Hardware: Raspberry Pi (4GB RAM)
- Users: <5 concurrent users
- Focus: Reliability over scalability

## Current Architecture Issues

1. **Configuration Vulnerability**: Critical services (persistence, entity_manager) can be disabled via environment variables
2. **Unclear Boundaries**: No clear distinction between mandatory infrastructure and optional features
3. **Fragile Startup**: Ad-hoc validation in `main.py` to check if persistence started
4. **Testing Complexity**: Difficult to mock core services independently
5. **Safety Compliance**: Current architecture doesn't align with ISO 26262 patterns for safety-critical systems

## Proposed Architecture

### Core Service Layer
A new initialization phase that runs before the FeatureManager, handling all mandatory infrastructure:

```
Application Startup
    â”œâ”€â”€ Phase 1: Core Services
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Persistence Service
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Database Manager
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Entity Manager
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ State Manager
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ CAN Interface
    â”‚
    â””â”€â”€ Phase 2: Feature Manager
        â”œâ”€â”€ Optional Features
        â”œâ”€â”€ Protocol Extensions
        â””â”€â”€ Analytics/Monitoring
```

### Service Categories

#### Tier 1: Core Infrastructure (Always Required)
- **persistence**: Data storage and configuration
- **database_manager**: Database connections and migrations
- **entity_manager**: Core state management

#### Tier 2: Core Application Services
- **app_state**: Application state (legacy compatibility)
- **websocket**: Real-time updates
- **can_interface**: CAN bus capability
- **state_manager**: System state tracking

#### Tier 3: Critical Protocol Support
- **rvc**: RV-C protocol (safety-critical)
- **domain_api_v2**: Safety-critical API architecture
- **entities_api_v2**: Position-critical entity control

#### Optional Features (Remain in FeatureManager)
- authentication, notifications, api_docs
- j1939, firefly, spartan_k2 (protocol extensions)
- analytics, diagnostics, monitoring features

    feature_manager: FeatureManager = Depends(get_feature_manager)
):
    """Unified health endpoint showing both core services and features."""
    return {
        "status": "healthy",  # or "degraded" if issues
        "core_services": await core_services.check_health(),

        "websocket": await self._check_websocket_health()
    }
```

##### Efficient Health Monitoring

```python
# backend/core/services.py
from prometheus_client import Gauge

# Single gauge for core service health (minimal overhead)
CORE_SERVICE_UP = Gauge(
    'coachiq_core_service_up',
    'Core service health (1=up, 0=down)',
    ['service']
)

async def check_health(self) -> dict[str, HealthStatus]:
    """Efficient health checks with Prometheus export."""
    health = {}

    # Quick health checks
    for service_name, service in [
        ("persistence", self._persistence),
        ("database", self._database_manager),
        ("entities", self._entity_manager)
    ]:
        if service and hasattr(service, 'health_check'):
            try:
                await service.health_check()
                health[service_name] = {"status": "healthy"}
                CORE_SERVICE_UP.labels(service=service_name).set(1)
            except Exception as e:
                health[service_name] = {"status": "unhealthy", "error": str(e)}
                CORE_SERVICE_UP.labels(service=service_name).set(0)
        else:
            health[service_name] = {"status": "not_initialized"}
            CORE_SERVICE_UP.labels(service=service_name).set(0)

    return health

- âœ… **No Configuration Changes**: Environment variables unchanged
- âœ… **Gradual Migration Not Required**: Direct cutover successful due to comprehensive testing
- âœ… **Legacy Compatibility**: PersistenceFeature singleton still available for any remaining dependencies

**If Rollback Were Needed (theoretical):**
1. Revert CoreServices initialization in main.py
2. Re-add persistence to feature_flags.yaml
3. Restore persistence dependencies in affected features
4. Remove CoreServices injection from FeatureManager

**Risk Assessment**: Very low rollback risk due to:
- No environment variable changes
- Comprehensive test validation
- Backward compatibility maintained
- Simple, isolated changes
