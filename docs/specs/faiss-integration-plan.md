# FAISS Integration Plan for RV-C Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the plan to incorporate FAISS vector database integration into the rvc2api project to enhance RV-C protocol interpretation, validation, and discovery. The system will leverage semantic search capabilities through vector embeddings to improve the accuracy and completeness of our RV-C decoder.

## Goals

1. **Enhance DGN Validation**: Validate that decoded DGN values match the official RV-C specification
2. **Identify Missing Mappings**: Discover gaps in our current rvc.json mappings
3. **Detect Additional Devices**: Identify devices in the RV-C specification that aren't currently mapped
