# Frontend API Endpoint Review Report

## Executive Summary

After a comprehensive review of the frontend codebase, I found that **the frontend is already well-aligned with the new backend architecture**. The frontend is correctly using Domain API v2 patterns, proper health endpoints, modern authentication, and correct error handling patterns.

## Review Results

### ✅ Domain API v2 Usage

The frontend is correctly using Domain API v2 endpoints:
- **Entity operations**: Using `/api/v2/entities` endpoints
- **Bulk operations**: Properly implemented with `/api/v2/entities/bulk-control`
- **Fallback support**: Includes backward compatibility with legacy endpoints when needed
- **Validation**: Includes Zod runtime validation for enhanced safety

Key files:
- `frontend/src/api/domains/entities.ts`: Full Domain API v2 implementation
- `frontend/src/hooks/domains/useEntitiesV2.ts`: React Query hooks with optimistic updates
- `frontend/src/api/endpoints.ts`: Main API client using v2 endpoints

### ✅ Unified Entity Endpoints

The frontend correctly uses unified entity endpoints:
- Uses `/api/entities` (through v2 `/api/v2/entities`) for all entity operations
- NO device-specific endpoints like `/api/lights` or `/api/locks`
- Proper entity type filtering through query parameters

### ✅ Health Endpoints

The frontend is correctly using root-level health endpoints:
- `/healthz` - Liveness check (line 94 in useHealthStatus.ts)
- `/readyz` - Readiness check (line 61 in useHealthStatus.ts)
- `/startupz` - Startup check (line 125 in useHealthStatus.ts)
- `/health` - Human-readable health info (line 158 in useHealthStatus.ts)

These are correctly at the root level, NOT under `/api/`.

### ✅ WebSocket Connections

WebSocket implementation follows correct patterns:
- Uses `/ws` endpoints for real-time connections
- Proper authentication with JWT tokens in query parameters
- Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
- Heartbeat mechanism for connection health

Key files:
- `frontend/src/api/websocket.ts`: WebSocket client implementation
- Connection endpoints: `/ws`, `/ws/can-sniffer`, `/ws/features`, `/ws/logs`

### ✅ Authentication Patterns

Modern authentication correctly implemented:
- JWT Bearer token authentication
- Tokens stored in localStorage
- Automatic token refresh support
- Proper `Authorization: Bearer {token}` headers

Key implementation in `frontend/src/api/client.ts`:
```typescript
function getAuthHeader(): Record<string, string> {
  const token = localStorage.getItem('auth_token');
  return token ? { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}` } : {};
}
```

### ✅ Error Handling

Frontend uses correct error response format:
- Uses `status` field with values: 'success', 'failed', 'timeout', 'unauthorized'
- NO boolean `success` field
- Proper TypeScript types in `OperationResultSchema`
- Enhanced error handling for bulk operations

### ✅ Entity Control Commands

Control commands use the proper structure:
```typescript
interface ControlCommandSchema {
  command: 'set' | 'toggle' | 'brightness_up' | 'brightness_down';
  state?: boolean | null;
  brightness?: number | null;
  parameters?: Record<string, string | number | boolean> | null;
}
```

### ✅ React Hooks

Domain API v2 hooks properly implemented:
- `useEntitiesV2()` - Fetch entities with pagination
- `useControlEntityV2()` - Single entity control with optimistic updates
- `useBulkControlEntitiesV2()` - Bulk operations with safety features
- Safety-aware optimistic updates that disable when using legacy API fallback

### ✅ CAN Bus Endpoints

CAN-related pages and APIs correctly use modern patterns:
- `/api/can/interfaces` - Get CAN interfaces
- `/api/can/status` - Get CAN statistics
- `/api/can/send` - Send CAN messages
- `/api/can/recent` - Get recent CAN messages
- `/api/can/metrics` - Get CAN metrics
- `/api/can/queue/status` - Get queue status
- `/api/config/can/interfaces` - CAN interface configuration

Specialized CAN tools use their own API patterns:
- `/api/can-tools/*` - CAN injection and testing tools
- `/api/can-analyzer/*` - Protocol analysis endpoints
- `/api/can-recorder/*` - CAN recording functionality
- `/api/can-filter/*` - CAN filtering rules

### ✅ RVC Protocol Endpoints

RVC-specific endpoints are properly implemented:
- `/api/config/spec` - Fetch RV-C specification
- Protocol filtering through entity queries: `fetchEntities({ protocol: 'rvc' })`
- RVC decoding integrated into CAN analyzer endpoints

### ✅ Diagnostics Endpoints

Diagnostics APIs use Domain API v2 patterns:
- `/api/v2/diagnostics/dtcs` - Diagnostic trouble codes
- `/api/v2/diagnostics/statistics` - Diagnostic statistics
- `/api/v2/diagnostics/correlations` - Fault correlations
- `/api/v2/diagnostics/predictions` - Maintenance predictions
- `/api/v2/diagnostics/health` - Diagnostics service health
- `/api/diagnostics/health` - System health (legacy compatibility)

Backend-computed endpoints for enhanced performance:
- Backend aggregation with frontend fallback patterns
- Graceful degradation when enhanced APIs unavailable

## Areas of Excellence

1. **Safety-First Design**: Optimistic updates are intelligently disabled when falling back to legacy APIs to prevent dangerous state mismatches in vehicle control systems.

2. **Comprehensive Validation**: Frontend includes Zod runtime validation that matches backend schemas for additional safety.

3. **Bulk Operation Support**: Full implementation of bulk operations with partial success handling, timeout management, and detailed error reporting.

4. **Progressive Enhancement**: Domain API v2 is used when available with automatic fallback to legacy endpoints, ensuring smooth migration.

5. **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript types that match backend Pydantic schemas exactly.

## No Changes Required

Based on this comprehensive review, **no changes are needed to the frontend API usage**. The frontend is already:
- Using all the correct endpoint patterns
- Following modern authentication practices
- Implementing proper error handling
- Using safety-aware optimistic updates
- Supporting bulk operations efficiently
- CAN/RVC/Diagnostics pages use appropriate API endpoints
- All specialized tools (CAN sniffer, analyzer, recorder) properly integrated

## Recommendations

While no changes are required, here are some optional enhancements to consider:

1. **Remove Legacy Fallbacks**: Once the backend fully removes legacy endpoints, the fallback code in `withDomainAPIFallback()` can be removed.

2. **Enhanced Monitoring**: Consider adding more detailed telemetry for bulk operations to track performance and success rates.

3. **Schema Synchronization**: Consider automating the TypeScript type generation from backend Pydantic schemas to ensure they stay in sync.

## Conclusion

The frontend codebase demonstrates excellent alignment with the modern backend architecture. The implementation shows careful attention to:
- Safety in vehicle control systems
- Progressive migration strategies
- Type safety and validation
- Performance optimization with bulk operations
- Real-time updates via WebSockets

No immediate changes are required. The frontend is production-ready for the new backend architecture.
