# Web UI Migration to React

This document summarizes the migration process from the original Jinja2/FastAPI-served UI to the new standalone React application.

## Migration Overview

The UI has been successfully migrated from a server-side rendered Jinja2 template system to a modern React application with the following improvements:

1. **Decoupled Architecture**

   - Frontend is now completely separate from the backend
   - Independent development cycles for UI and API
   - Can be deployed and hosted separately

2. **Modern Technology Stack**

   - React 19 with hooks and functional components
   - TypeScript for type safety
   - Vite for fast development and optimized builds
   - TailwindCSS for modern styling

3. **Improved Developer Experience**

   - Hot module replacement for instant feedback
   - Type checking with TypeScript
   - ESLint for code quality
   - Jest for testing
   - Modern dev tools integration

4. **Better User Experience**
   - More responsive UI with client-side rendering
   - Modern animations and transitions
   - Improved accessibility
   - Mobile-friendly responsive design

## Implemented Features

The new UI includes all features from the original interface:

- Dashboard with system status
- Light control interface
- CAN message sniffer
- Device mapping
- Network visualization
- RVC specification viewer
- Unmapped entries and unknown PGNs

## API Integration

The React frontend communicates with the backend through:

- REST API endpoints for data fetching and commands
- WebSocket for real-time updates

## Deployment

The new frontend can be served in two ways:

1. **Development Mode**

   ```bash
   cd web_ui
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Production Mode**

   ```bash
   cd web_ui
   npm run build
   ```

   The built files (in `dist/`) can be served by Caddy or another web server.

## Testing

The React UI includes a Jest testing setup:

- Component tests with React Testing Library
- Basic test coverage reporting
- Integration with the development workflow

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements for the React UI:

1. More comprehensive test coverage
2. Additional data visualization components
3. Improved mobile responsiveness
4. Dark/light theme switching
5. Enhanced accessibility features
