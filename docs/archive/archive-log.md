# Documentation Archive Log

This log tracks documentation files that have been archived and the reasons why.

## Archive Date: January 2025

### Reason: Simplifying documentation for hobby project

As per the documentation strategy, we're keeping only essential documentation for a personal RV project running on Raspberry Pi. Files archived here contain historical information that may be useful for reference but aren't needed for day-to-day operation.

## Archived Files

### Development Environment Docs (Outdated/Redundant)
- `pdf-processing-guide.md` - Vector search feature not used in hobby deployment
- `pdf-processing-guide-new.md` - Duplicate of above
- `poetry2nix-integration.md` - Nix setup overly complex for hobby use
- `nix-minimal-config-example.md` - Using simpler setup now
- `nix-devcontainer-performance.md` - Not using devcontainers
- `mixed-chunking-strategies.md` - Related to unused vector search

### GitHub/CI Docs (Not needed for personal project)
- `github-pages-deployment.md` - Not deploying docs publicly
- `enabling-github-pages.md` - Not using GitHub pages
- `github-actions.md` - No CI/CD for hobby project
- `github-actions-summary.md` - No CI/CD for hobby project
- `version-management.md` - Simple git tags sufficient

### Frontend Theming (Completed work)
- `frontend-theming.md` - Migration already completed

### Old Configuration Docs (Superseded)
- `environment-variable-integration.md` - Info now in main setup docs
