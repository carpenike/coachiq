# Code Quality Tools

This document outlines the code quality tools used in the `CoachIQ` project.

## Python Code Quality Tools

### Ruff

[Ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff) is our primary Python linting tool. It's a fast, comprehensive linter written in Rust that replaces Flake8 and many of its plugins.

#### Key features

- 10-100x faster than Flake8
- Includes functionality from multiple Flake8 plugins
- Can automatically fix many issues
- Import sorting (replacing isort)
- Configurable through `pyproject.toml`

#### Usage

```bash
# Check your code
poetry run ruff check .

# Apply auto-fixes
poetry run ruff check --fix .
```

### Ruff Format

[Ruff Format](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/formatter/) is our Python code formatter. It enforces a consistent style by reformatting your code to conform to its rules, similar to Black but integrated with the Ruff toolchain.

#### Key features

- Deterministic formatting
- Fast performance
- Integrated with Ruff linting
- Compatible with Black-style formatting

#### Usage

```bash
# Format your code
poetry run ruff format src tests
```

### Pyright/Pylance

[Pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright) is our standardized static type checker for Python, used in VS Code via the Pylance extension. We've standardized on Pyright as our sole type checker due to its superior performance and integration with modern Python tools.

#### Key features

- Fast, incremental type checking
- Excellent IDE integration
- Strong support for modern Python typing features
- Better performance for larger codebases
- Native support for FastAPI and Pydantic type annotations

#### Usage

```bash
# Type check your code
npx pyright src

# Or in VS Code:
# Use the built-in type checking with Pylance
```

## Pre-commit Integration

These tools are integrated into our [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) configuration, ensuring code quality checks run automatically before each commit.

To set up pre-commit:

```bash
# Install pre-commit hooks
poetry run pre-commit install
```

## Custom Type Stubs

The project includes custom type stubs in the `typings/` directory to enhance type checking and IDE support, particularly for third-party libraries.

### FastAPI Type Stubs

We maintain custom type stubs for FastAPI to provide better typing for WebSocket components and other FastAPI features.

#### Organization

- `typings/fastapi/__init__.py` - Implementation file with detailed docstrings
- `typings/fastapi/__init__.pyi` - Type stub file with concise type definitions

#### Special Configuration

These files have specific lint exceptions in `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
[tool.ruff.lint.per-file-ignores]
# Allow function names that don't follow snake_case for FastAPI compatibility
# Also allow exception names without Error suffix to match FastAPI's conventions
"typings/fastapi/__init__.py" = ["N802", "N818"]
"typings/fastapi/__init__.pyi" = ["N802", "N818"]
# Allow relative imports in the typings directory for proper type stub organization
"typings/**/*.py" = ["TID252"]
"typings/**/*.pyi" = ["TID252"]
```

These exceptions allow:

- Non-snake_case function names (like `Body()`) to match FastAPI's API
- Exception names without the "Error" suffix (like `WebSocketDisconnect`) to match FastAPI's conventions
- Relative imports in type stub files for proper organization

For more details, see `typings/fastapi/README.md`.

## Why We Chose These Tools

- **Ruff over Flake8**: Ruff is significantly faster and includes all the functionality of Flake8 plus much more. It also has better integration with modern Python tooling.
- **Ruff Format over Black**: Ruff Format provides the same deterministic formatting as Black but is integrated with the Ruff toolchain, offering better performance and consistency with linting rules.
- **Pyright over mypy for type checking**: We've standardized on Pyright because it offers excellent performance, strong IDE integration via VS Code's Pylance extension, and better support for modern Python typing features, especially with FastAPI and Pydantic. It also provides faster type checking for large codebases.
- **Custom Type Stubs**: For better IDE support and type checking with libraries like FastAPI.

## VS Code Integration

VS Code tasks are configured for these tools:

- **Format Code (Ruff)**: Formats Python code
- **Lint (Ruff)**: Runs Ruff linting with fix capability
- **Type Check (Pyright)**: Performs static type checking
