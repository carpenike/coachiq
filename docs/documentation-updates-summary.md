# Documentation Organization Changes

## Changes Implemented

1. **Fixed MCP Tools formatting issues**:

   - Corrected formatting in `mcp-tools.instructions.md`
   - Resolved conflicting text and improper code block closure

2. **Consolidated VS Code tasks information**:

   - Removed detailed VS Code tasks from `dev-environment.instructions.md`
   - Added reference to the dedicated `vscode-tasks.instructions.md` file
   - Ensured consistent task references across documentation

3. **Created dedicated style guide files**:

   - Added `python-code-style.instructions.md` with comprehensive Python styling guidelines
   - Added `typescript-code-style.instructions.md` with TypeScript/React styling guidelines
   - Clearly distinguished between style guides (coding patterns) and configuration files (tooling setup)
   - Both style guide files follow the same structure for consistency

4. **Added cross-references between related files**:

   - Added "See Also" sections to Python backend, React frontend, style guides
   - Linked related documentation within each file
   - Improved navigation between related instruction files

5. **Updated the instructions README**:

   - Reorganized into logical categories (Architecture, Code Style, Workflow, etc.)
   - Added MCP tools integration section
   - Added VS Code tasks integration section

6. **Enhanced the main README**:

   - Added more detailed information about development tools
   - Emphasized the importance of using Context7 first
   - Added links to new documentation files

7. **Updated docs/enhanced-dev-environment.md**:

   - Added references to the new instruction files
   - Organized links by category

8. **Updated docs/mcp-tools-setup.md**:
   - Added best practices section with clear examples
   - Incorporated "When to Prioritize Context7" section
   - Added links to related documentation

## Organization Structure

The documentation is now organized in a more logical structure:

1. **Core Architecture**:

   - project-overview.instructions.md
   - python-backend.instructions.md
   - react-frontend.instructions.md

2. **Code Style and Quality**:

   - python-code-style.instructions.md
   - typescript-code-style.instructions.md
   - eslint-typescript-config.instructions.md
   - code-style.instructions.md (legacy)

3. **Development Workflow**:

   - dev-environment.instructions.md
   - vscode-tasks.instructions.md
   - testing.instructions.md
   - pull-requests.instructions.md

4. **Tools and Configuration**:

   - mcp-tools.instructions.md
   - env-vars.instructions.md

5. **Legacy Documentation**:
   - webui.instructions.md

## Benefits

1. **Reduced redundancy**: Eliminated duplicate information
2. **Better navigation**: Added cross-references between related files
3. **Consistent structure**: Style guide files follow the same pattern
4. **Clear organization**: Files grouped by logical categories
5. **Improved MCP guidance**: Clearer emphasis on using Context7 first
6. **Balanced coverage**: Equal treatment of frontend and backend documentation
7. **Complementary documentation**: Maintained both `typescript-code-style.instructions.md` and `eslint-typescript-config.instructions.md` files with clear distinctions:
   - Style guide focuses on coding patterns and practices
   - Config file focuses on tooling setup and troubleshooting
