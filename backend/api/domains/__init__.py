"""
Domain API Routers Package

This package contains domain-specific API routers for the v2 API architecture.
Each domain provides enhanced capabilities over the legacy monolithic API.

Domain routers:
- entities: Entity management and control operations
- diagnostics: Diagnostic trouble codes and system health
- networks: Network topology and device discovery
- system: System-level configuration and monitoring

Safety-Critical Implementation:
- All domain APIs are disabled by default via feature flags
- Command/acknowledgment patterns for vehicle control
- State reconciliation with RV-C bus as source of truth
- Comprehensive audit logging for all operations
