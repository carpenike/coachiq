CAN Bus Decoder Safety Validation Tests

This module contains comprehensive safety validation tests for the CAN decoder
architecture improvements. Tests critical safety scenarios that could result
in dangerous vehicle operations if not properly handled.

CRITICAL: These tests validate safety-critical behavior that prevents:
- Slideout operation while vehicle is moving
- Engine start when transmission not in park
- Emergency stop functionality
- Load testing under realistic CAN traffic
