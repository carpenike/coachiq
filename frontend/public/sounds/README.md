# Alert Sounds

This directory should contain the following alert sound files:

- `critical-alert.mp3` - For critical system failures
- `warning-alert.mp3` - For system warnings

These files are used by the health monitoring system to provide audio alerts when system issues are detected.

## Requirements

- Files should be in MP3 format for broad browser compatibility
- Keep file sizes small (< 100KB) for quick loading
- Volume should be normalized to prevent jarring alerts

## Placeholder

Until proper sound files are added, the system will gracefully handle missing audio files without errors.
