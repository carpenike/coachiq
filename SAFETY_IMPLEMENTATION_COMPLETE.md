- âœ… Added stronger typing (`dict[str, Feature]`)
- âœ… Created validation script for YAML structure

### âœ… Phase 2: Feature State Machine (Complete)
- âœ… Implemented `FeatureState` enum with 7 states (STOPPED, INITIALIZING, HEALTHY, DEGRADED, FAILED, SAFE_SHUTDOWN, MAINTENANCE)
- âœ… Added health check methods to `Feature` base class
- âœ… Implemented health propagation logic with dependency graph
- âœ… Created reverse dependency graph for efficient propagation
- âœ… Added comprehensive logging for state transitions with safety validation

### âœ… Phase 3: Safety Patterns (Complete)
- âœ… Implemented watchdog timer pattern with configurable timeouts
- âœ… Created safe state transition logic with "maintain current position" philosophy
- âœ… Added device state capture mechanisms for forensics
- âœ… Implemented command disabling for safe state
- âœ… Created monitoring-only mode for degraded operation
- âœ… Added emergency stop functionality with proper authorization

### âœ… Phase 4: Runtime Management (Complete)
- âœ… Implemented controlled feature toggling with safety validation
- âœ… Added comprehensive audit logging for all state changes
- âœ… Created dependency validation for toggles
- âœ… Added safety override mechanisms with proper authorization codes
- âœ… Implemented recovery workflows with retry logic and bulk operations

### âœ… Phase 5: Testing and Validation (Complete)
- âœ… Created comprehensive test suite for dependency resolution (`test_feature_manager_safety.py`)
- âœ… Added integration tests for safe state transitions (`test_safety_integration.py`)
- âœ… Tested health propagation scenarios
- âœ… Validated configuration loading edge cases
- âœ… Performance testing for health monitoring loops
- âœ… Created validation script that confirms all safety patterns work correctly

## Safety Features Implemented

### 1. 5-Tier Safety Classification System
- **Critical**: System cannot operate safely without this feature (7 features)
- **Safety-Related**: Impacts safety but system can continue with limitations (5 features)
- **Position-Critical**: Controls physical positioning that shouldn't change in emergencies (2 features)
- **Operational**: Important for operation but not safety-critical (16 features)
- **Maintenance**: Diagnostic and utility features (6 features)

### 2. ISO 26262-Inspired State Machine
- **STOPPED**: Feature is not running
- **INITIALIZING**: Feature is starting up
- **HEALTHY**: Feature is operating normally
- **DEGRADED**: Feature is partially functional or dependency failed
- **FAILED**: Feature is non-functional
- **SAFE_SHUTDOWN**: Controlled shutdown for safety
- **MAINTENANCE**: Intentionally offline for service

### 3. Safety Interlocks
- **Slide Room Safety**: Prevents operation when vehicle is moving
- **Awning Safety**: Requires parking brake and stationary vehicle
- **Leveling Jack Safety**: Multiple safety conditions including engine state

### 4. Emergency Stop System
- **Automatic Triggering**: On critical feature failures or multiple interlock violations
- **Manual Activation**: Via API with proper authorization
- **Safe State Entry**: All position-critical features enter SAFE_SHUTDOWN
- **Recovery**: Requires manual authorization code for reset

### 5. Watchdog Monitoring
- **Health Check Loop**: Configurable interval monitoring
- **Watchdog Timer**: Automatic safe state entry on timeout
- **Performance Monitoring**: Alerts when monitoring loops take too long

### 6. Runtime Feature Management
- **Safety-Critical Protection**: Cannot be toggled without override
- **Authorization Codes**: Required for safety overrides
- **Dependency Validation**: Prevents disabling features with critical dependents
- **Position-Critical Checks**: Prevents changes while devices are deployed

### 7. Recovery Workflows
- **Single Feature Recovery**: With retry logic and exponential backoff
- **Bulk Recovery**: Processes multiple features in dependency order
- **Recovery Recommendations**: Analyzes failed features and provides guidance
- **Automatic Dependency Clearing**: Removes recovered dependencies from failed lists

### 8. Comprehensive Audit Logging
- **All State Changes**: Logged with timestamps and reasons
- **User Actions**: Tracked with user identification and authorization
- **Safety Events**: Emergency stops, interlock engagements, override attempts
- **Performance Metrics**: Health check durations and system performance

## Validation Results

âœ… **All Safety Validations Passed**

The comprehensive validation script confirms:
- Safety classifications are properly defined for all 36 features
- State machine transitions follow ISO 26262-inspired safety rules
- Dependency resolution works correctly without circular dependencies
- Safety service creates and manages interlocks properly
- Emergency stop and recovery procedures work as designed
- Runtime toggling correctly enforces safety constraints
- Recovery workflows provide appropriate recommendations
- Audit logging captures all safety-critical events
