This protocol recommends that suggested\nconnectors be used for the network trunk. A list of suggested connectors follows for the network trunk in Table 2.1.4a, but\ndesigners are free to use connectors according to their utility in their specific application. All trunk connectors should use\nstandardized pin-out convention listed in Table 2.1.4a except for established circular connectors. If the standard pin-out\nconvention is not used then the equipment or connectors must be labeled with the pin-outs used. The chassis routing should only\nuse sealed connectors and the interior may use sealed or unsealed connectors. Connections to the network trunk cable should\nbe direct or short drop cables connecting to network devices and should use connectors appropriate to the device manufacturer\u2019s\nproducts.

An RV\nmay have seven or more awnings, four climate control zones, two or more inverters, and dozens of lights, keypads, and the like.\nThis factor had to be addressed in a simple, direct manner. The means the committee devised is called \"Instancing\".\nDevice types (see table 3.2a) in RV-C are defined as either single-instance or multiple-instance. There are very few of the former\nitems - generator, GPS and chassis being examples. Data packets for these devices have no special provisions for identifying\nthe source or target of the packet. But data packets involving multiple-instance device types always have as the first data byte\nthe \"Instance\" for the source or target device. The Instance is a tag that identifies which specific physical device of a particular\ndevice type within the RV is referenced in the DGN. For example, Awning Instance 1 refers to the main patio awning, whereas\nAwning Instance 2 refers to a different awning on the same RV.\nInstances are always in reference to a device type, so instance numbers can be duplicated across different device types. There\nmay be an Awning Instance 1, a Thermostat Instance 1, and a DC Load Instance 1, all coexisting on the network. Every\ninstanced DGN is specific to a particular device type, and are organized accordingly in the RV-C protocol document.\nThe Instance is completely distinct from the Source Address. The Source Address identifies the CAN node - that is, the\nmicroprocessor that is sending and receiving data. The Instance identifies the physical device \u2013 awning #1, inverter #3, tank #2,\netc.. - being described or commanded in the message. The Instance is always a single data byte, usually with a value from 1 to\n250. (Some device types have limitations on the range of values, and some devices have more complicated schemes.) In most\ncases the value is arbitrary, though for some device types RV-C assigns a specific meaning to certain numbers. In almost all\ncases, zero is not a valid Instance for a device.\nFor example, for an Awning Instance 1 is defined as the Main Patio Awning. A large RV may have several smaller awnings\nassigned Instances 2 and higher. Any command to the patio awning would have a first data byte of 1, and any status information\nabout that awning would also have the same first data byte. The same would be true for the other awnings, with the appropriate\nInstance put in the first data byte.\nThe Instances always refer to the physical device rather than the microprocessor that is processing the message. A single\nmicroprocessor often handles several Instances of a device type. For example, a wall thermostat may handle several climate\ncontrol zones. The microprocessor in that thermostat would send and parse messages for each climate control zone Instance\nindependently. It is even possible (though rare) for one device Instance to be spread over multiple microprocessors. Each\nprocessor would have different Source Address, but use the same Instance.\nRV-C does not specify how the Instance is assigned to a device. A general DGN is provided, but manufacturers may also use dip\nswitches, jumpers, or even hard-coding to establish which physical device is assigned each Instance.\n3.2.4.2\nInformation sharing\nMost RV-C nodes have associated with them a set of data, which it broadcasts on the network. For example, a generator\ntransmits data on it loading, fuel consumption, AC amperage and voltage, coolant temperature, and so on. To accomplish this,\nmessages may be defined and DGNs assigned to these messages. All information sharing may be accomplished through these\npre-formatted messages.\nInformation sharing messages are generally set at priority 6. Exceptionally, higher priorities may be used for time-sensitive data\n(such as data used in mechanical controls). Information sharing messages requiring more than 8 data bytes are distributed to\nseveral network, transport, and application layer messages. Even if the RV-C node does not support every item in the packet, the\nentire packet shall be sent. Certain values are used to indicate that a particular datum is not supported or is not available at the\nNovember 6, 2023\n3.2.4.2 -  Information sharing\n\n\u00a9 RVIA\nRV-C\n17\nmoment.\nEach RV-C node may have several messages associated with it. It is also possible that two RV-C nodes may \"share\" a message\n\u2013 each may transmit different data items from the same group.\nMany data packets may be set to broadcast \"on change\" rather than on a schedule \u2013 that is, whenever certain data items change\nin value. Some may adjust their broadcast frequency according to whether the RV-C node is \"active\".\nThe minimum broadcast gap for data packets is 50 ms unless otherwise specified in the DGN table for each device. For a\ncommand signal data packet, the minimum broadcast gap is \u201cas needed\u201d unless otherwise specified by the DGN table for that\ndevice.\n3.2.4.3\nInformation request\nMost information request messages are broadcast repeatedly at a set rate, but sometimes a RV-C node may need to request a\ndatum be transmitted immediately. To accomplish this, a RV-C node broadcasts a \"request for DGN\" message. All RV-C nodes\nthat support that DGN are required to respond to such requests.\nThe request for DGN message is defined in Table 3.2.4.3a.and 3.2.4.3b.\nTable 3.2.4.3a - Request for DGN\nAttribute\nValue definition\nDGN\nEA00h\nDGN-High\nEAh\nDGN-Low\nDestination address or FFh (global)\nPriority:\n6\nBroadcast gap\nAs needed\nTable 3.2.4.3b \u2014 Signal and parameter definition\nByte\nBit\nName\nData Type\nUnit\n0 to 2\n-\nDesired DGN\nuint17\n-\n0h - 1FFFFh.

However, for multi-instanced device types, this is not true. All RV-C\nmessages are 8 bytes in length (see section 3.1), including this message.\nInstancing was added to this message in 2019. It remains acceptable for nodes to respond to this per the earlier practice, which\nhad no reference to the Instance or Secondary Instance. That is, receiving nodes may ignore Byte 3 and Byte 4 and report their\nstatus regardless of their Instance.\n3.2.4.4\nAcknowledgment\nCertain messages require an Acknowledgment from the node they target. An ACK or NAK message is required in the following\ncircumstances:\n1. A Request for DGN is directed to a specific address, and the node at that address does not support that DGN. If the Request\nis directed globally then no NAK is required. If the DGN is supported, then the node shall not send an acknowledgment, but\nNovember 6, 2023\n3.2.4.4 -  Acknowledgment\n\n\u00a9 RVIA\nRV-C\n18\ninstead shall send the requested DGN.  If a node implements multiple instances of the related device type it should only send a\nNAK if each and every one of the instances it manages doesn\u2019t support that DGN; if one or more of the instances does support\nthe requested DGN, it should respond with the requested DGN for each supporting instance and no NAK should be sent.\n2. A command DGN is broadcast that the node supports and for which an acknowledgment is indicated in the DGN definition. If\nthe definition calls for an ACK, the node shall respond, either in a positive or a negative way. If the result is negative, an\nappropriate code shall be provided in the response. If the definition calls for a NAK, the node shall only respond if the result is\nnegative.\n3. If a request for DGN is directed to a specific address with a particular instance indicated in the request\u2019s \u201cInstance\u201d field, but\nthat instance does not support the given DGN. E.g. a request for HEAT_PUMP_STATUS with specified instance 2 is requested\nfrom a node that manages three A/Cs, but the second A/C doesn\u2019t support that DGN, so a NAK is returned.\nIf the definition of a command DGN contains more than one possible command, and a node sends a command that the receiving\nnode does not support, the receiving node shall not send an acknowledgment. It shall only send an acknowledgment if the\nspecific command is supported by the receiving node. For example, AWNING_COMMAND includes both a manual movement\ncommand byte and an automatic movement command byte. If an awning receives a DGN directing an automatic movement, but\nthe device does not support that feature, it shall not send an acknowledgment. If it does support the feature but is prevented from\nacting (say, due to movement of the RV) then it shall send the acknowledgment (NAK), with an appropriate code indicating the\nproblem.\nThe ACK/NAK DGN shall be sent as a destination-specific DGN, with DGN-Low equal to the address of the node that sent the\noriginal command or request. It should be noted that many legacy devices and devices designed for certain other protocols might\nsend this DGN as a global DGN, with DGN-Low equal to 255 (FFh).\nTable 3.2.4.4a and 3.2.4.4b defines the acknowledgment.\nTable 3.2.4.4a: Acknowledgment\nAttribute\nValue definition\nDGN\nE800h\nDGN-High\nE8h\nDGN-Low\nDestination Address, or FFh\nPriority\n6\nBroadcast gap\nAs needed.\nTable 3.2.4.4b \u2014 Signal and parameter definition\nByte\nBit\nName\nData Type\nUnit\n0\n-\nAcknowledgment Code\nuint8\n-\nsee Table 7.5\n1\n-\nInstance\nuint8\n-\nInstance of the transmitter, if multi-instanced.\nFFh if not multi-instanced.\n2\n0 to 3\nInstance Bank\nuint4\n-\nInstance Bank of transmitter, if multi-banked.\n2\n4 to 7\nReserved\nuint4\n-\nReserved for compatibility with SAE J1939.

LSB first.\nThe ACK/NAK DGN contains a data field containing the command DGN, and a field containing the response code (\u201cACK Code\u201d).\nIf the command is successfully implemented, the node shall place a 0 (zero) in the ACK Code field. (This is often referred to as\nan \u201cACK\u201d message.) If the command cannot be implemented, the node shall indicate the nature of the failure by placing an\nappropriate code in this field. (This is often referred to as a \u201cNAK\u201d message.) The list of valid codes is provided in Table 7.5.\nNovember 6, 2023\n3.2.4.4 -  Acknowledgment\n\n\u00a9 RVIA\nRV-C\n19\nTo provide greater detail, a ranges of codes is set aside that vary with the specific command DGN. These codes shall be set in\nthe range 128-250, and documented with the DGN definition. Thus, the NAK code 250 may have a different meaning in response\nto a AWNING_COMMAND than to a GENERATOR_COMMAND.\nAny non-zero code indicates that the command was not successfully completed.\n3.2.4.5\nControl message\nControl messages are similar to information sharing messages, but are usually set at a higher priority. All control messages\ntrigger a specific information sharing message in response, thus providing feedback to the controlling RV-C node. Often a control\nmessage will trigger a series of responses as the receiving RV-C node attempts to implement the command.\nFor example, a control panel may send a message to \"command\" the generator to start. The generator should immediately\nrespond with a message indicating that the generator will attempt to start (or with a message indicating that the generator can't\nstart). Once the generator has started, a second message should provide that feedback to the control panel.\nIn certain cases, controls may require acknowledgment in both directions. This is the case with many mechanical controls.\nConsider a leveling system and a control panel. In an \"automatic\" mode it is generally sufficient for the panel to send a control\nmessage to level the RV. The mechanism should send two messages in response \u2013 an immediate message confirming that it is\nnow leveling and a second message when it is complete. But in a \"manual\" mode, the control panel should repeat the message\nperiodically (and the mechanism should respond to each again), thus providing assurance that the system is correctly following\nthe user input. When the user is done, the control panel should send an explicit \"stop\" message. The frequency of these\nmessages depends somewhat on the physical characteristics of the system and the consequences of an error. If the mechanism\ndoes not receive any message within the expected time, it should respond in the safest manner possible.\nThese control and response behaviors shall be defined, approved and documented by the RVIA technical subcommittee as part\nof the RV-C standard.\n3.2.5\nDiagnostics message\n3.2.5.1\nIntroduction\nAll devices compliant to this communication profile shall support the \"DM_RV\" message. This message allows the\ncommunication of diagnostic information and general operating status. If there are no active faults, data bytes 2 to 5 shall be set\nto FFh. The DM_RV is still broadcast, allowing other nodes to see its operating status.\nThe broadcast gap of the DM-RV varies with the diagnostic status and other parameters. If a device is in a fault condition, the\nDM-RV shall be sent at a rate between 100 ms and 1000 ms, with the faster rate reserved for faults that might cause damage to\nother systems or compromise the safety of the occupants of the RV.\nIf multiple faults are active, the DM-RV shall be sent at a the appropriate rate for each fault; e.g. if two low-severity faults are\npresent, DM-RV should be broadcast every 1000 ms for both, leading to an actual DMRV broadcast rate of 500 ms. In rare\ncases, too many faults may be present to broadcast the DM-RV for each and maintain the minimum 50 ms gap between\nbroadcast messages; if this occurs, DM-RV broadcast rate can be slowed for each fault to achieve the 50 ms minimum gap.\nIf a device is not in a fault condition, the DM-RV is sent on request, or every 5000 ms.  Thus every device shall send at least one\nmessage every 5000ms \u2013 either a status DGN or a DM-RV.\nRegardless of the diagnostic status, the device shall send a DM-RV upon request. The DM-RV is also to be broadcast within\n1000 ms of when a previously broadcast fault is cleared.\nTable 3.2.5.1a defines the DG definition and Table 3.2.5.1b defines the signal and parameter definition for the active diagnostic\nmessage (\"DM_RV\").\nTable 3.2.5.1a \u2014 DG definition\nDG attribute\nValue\nName\nDM_RV\nNovember 6, 2023\n3.2.5.1 -  Introduction\n\n\u00a9 RVIA\nRV-C\n20\nDGN\n1FECAh\nDefault priority\n6\nMaximum broadcast gap\n100 ms where necessary for safety or to prevent damage.\n1000 ms for other fault conditions.\nNormal broadcast gap\nOn Change of Status\nMinimum broadcast gap\n5000 ms if no other status information has been sent by this device.\nNumber of frames\n1\nACK requirements\nNone\nTable 3.2.5.1b \u2014 Signal and parameter definition\nByte\nBit\nName\nData Type\nUnit\n0\n0 to 1\nOperating status\nuint2\n-\nsee 3.2.5.2\n2 to 3\nOperating status\nuint2\nsee 3.2.5.2\n4 to 5\nYellow Lamp status\nuint2\nsee 3.2.5.3\n6 to 7\nRed Lamp status\nuint2\nsee 3.2.5.3\n1\n-\nDSA\nuint8\n-\nsee 3.2.5.4\n2\n-\nSPN-MSB\nuint8\n-\nsee 3.2.5.5\n3\n-\nSPN-ISB\nuint8\n-\nsee 3.2.5.5\n4\n5 to 7\nSPN-LSB\nuint3\n-\nsee 3.2.5.5\n0 to 4\nFMI\nuint5\n-\nsee 3.2.5.8\n5\n0 to 6\nOccurrence count\nuint7\n-\n7Fh if not available\n7\nreserved\nN/A\n-\nalways 1\n6\n-\nDSA extension\nuint8\n-\nFFh \u2014 No DSA extension defined for product\n7\n0-3\nBank Select\nuint4\n-\n0-13. For devices where bank selection is\nsupported. Fh otherwise.\n3.2.5.2\nOperating status\nThe DM_RV provides a simple way for devices to indicate their general operating status. Generally there are two broad types of\ndevices.- those that are simply ON or OFF (defined in Table 3.2.5.2a), such as a lamp, and those that have a degree of\nautomation (defined in Table 3.2.5.2b), such as a climate control device or a charger.\nTable 3.2.5.2a \u2014 Operating status for simple devices\nBit 0 and 1\nBit 2 and 3\nDescription\n00b (OFF)\n00b (standby)\nDevice is disabled and not operating.

Every DM_RV includes bits\nfor encoding whether a given fault is \u201cYellow\u201d or a \u201cRed\u201d.\nThe classification of faults into \u201cYellow\u201d and \u201cRed\u201d is subjective. In general, \u201cYellow\u201d faults usually refer to conditions that are\nmanageable by the user or require little or no intervention. \u201cRed\u201d faults generally require a service technician or other substantial\nintervention. Nodes broadcasting multiple faults simultaneously may broadcast some faults as \u201cYellow\u201d and some as \u201cRed\u201d\ndepending on the severity of each.\nEXAMPLE - A low battery level to an inverter signal is a 'Yellow' fault.\nThe DM_RV is considered the \u201clast choice\u201d for indicating a problem condition. If there are provisions in the RV-C protocol for\nindicating a problem other than through the DM_RV, then that alternative method shall be preferred.\nEXAMPLE - An intelligent AC transfer switch uses the provisions in AC_STATUS_1 for indicating an Open Ground from\na shore line, rather than send a DM_RV. In this case the transfer switch is working properly, and is not in a fault\ncondition. The same might not apply to the output of a generator or inverter, since the open ground probably indicates\na wiring problem within the RV.\n3.2.5.4\nDefault Source Address (DSA)\nThe DSA is used by a device attempting to interpret the specific failure. Each device type has its own list of SPNs. The\ninterpretation of the SPN requires inspecting the DSA. Devices with more than one DSA assigned to them shall use the lowest\nDSA value available, regardless of the source address used by the device and whether multiple devices of the same type are\ninstalled on the network.\nEXAMPLE - The DM-RV for a Slide Room shall always use the DSA of 84.\"\nTo provide capacity for more devices than can be identified with the 8-bit DSA, the \u201cExtended DSA\u201d is defined. By default a\ndevice for which the Extended DSA is not defined shall use FFh (255) in the Extended DSA field. The Extended DSA is not used\nfor Source Address assignment, and only serves to identify the device type in the diagnostic message.\nNOTE - The system integrator takes care that only one statically addressed device with the same DSA and the same\nDSA extension, or the same DSA and different DSA extension is installed in a network.\n3.2.5.5\nService Point Number (SPN)\nThe SPN encodes the specific feature, component or sub-component that has failed in a device. There do exist common SPNs\n(see Table 7.3), which are common for all device types, and specific SPNs which are specific for a device type and depend on\nthe DSA of the device type.\nDepending on whether the device is a single-instance or multiple -instance device the SPN is encoded differently. Single-\ninstance devices have a 19-bit SPN identifier. Multiple-instance devices have an 11-bit SPN identifier and an 8-bit instance\nidentifier.\nTable 3.2.5.5 \u2014 SPN format\nData byte\nSingle instance device\nMultiple instance device\nMSB (Byte 2:Bits 0 to 7)\nMost significant byte of the SPN\nMost significant byte of the SPN\n00h \u2013 Fault applies to all sub-device instances\n01h-FAh \u2013 Fault applies to specific instance.\nNovember 6, 2023\n3.2.5.5 -  Service Point Number (SPN)\n\n\u00a9 RVIA\nRV-C\n22\nISB (Byte 3)\nIntermediate byte of the SPN\nInstance on the device\nLSB (Byte 4:Bits 5 to 7)\nLeast significant bits of the SPN\nLeast significant bits of the SPN\nEXAMPLE -\nByte 3 = 01h = 0000 0001b (SPN = 0000 0001 b)\nByte 4 = 03h = 0000 0011b\nByte 5 = C0h = 1100 0000b (SPN = 110b)\nIf Single instance device \u2013 SPN = 00 0001 0000 0011 110b = 081E= 2078h\nIf Multiple instance device - Instance = 3; SPN = 00 0001 110b = 000Eh = 15\n3.2.5.6\nGeneric faults in multiple instance devices\nSPN values of 00h to FFh are reserved for faults that are common to all RV-C devices. They refer to faults which are generic to\nall devices, e.g. faults in the communication itself or the microprocessor.\nMultiple instance devices shall signal those faults without reference to the specific instance. The encoding of a single instance\ndevice shall apply for those faults on a multiple instance device.\n3.2.5.7\nDevices with multiple instances of sub-devices\nUniversal faults shall be signaled with the MSB set to 00h. Faults specific to the instance of a device shall have a MSB unequal\nto 00h, except generic faults (see 3.2.5.6).\nNOTE - The number of universal faults for a multiple instance device is limited to 2048 SPNs.\nEXAMPLE - A slide room controller has universal faults, e.g. the lack of a park brake signal, and instance specific\nfaults, e.g. the slide room limit switch.\n3.2.5.8\nFailure mode identifier\nThe failure mode identifiers (FMI) are defined in Table 3.2.5.8. The FMI is universal to all devices, regardless of type.\nTable 3.2.5.8 - Failure mode identifier\nValue\nDescription\n0\nDatum value above normal range\n1\nDatum value below normal range\n2\nDatum value erratic or invalid\n3\nShort circuit to high voltage (or complete sensor input failure)\n4\nShort circuit to low voltage (or complete sensor input failure)\n5\nOpen circuit, or output current below normal\n6\nGrounded circuit, or output current above normal\n7\nMechanical device not responding\n8\nDatum value showing error of frequency, pulse width, or period\n9\nDatum not updating at proper rate\n10\nDatum value fluctuating at abnormal rate\n11\nFailure not identifiable\n12\nBad intelligent RV-C node\n13\nCalibration required\n14\n\"None of the above\" (use sparingly!)\n15\nDatum valid but above normal operational range (least severe)\nNovember 6, 2023\n3.2.5.8 -  Failure mode identifier\n\n\u00a9 RVIA\nRV-C\n23\n16\nDatum valid but above normal operational range (moderately severe)\n17\nDatum valid but below normal operational range (least severe)\n18\nDatum valid but below normal operational range (moderately severe)\n19\nReceived invalid network datum\n20\nNetwork Device Not Responding\n21\nNetworked Device Not Responding (failure due to the unresponsiveness of a second networked\ndevice)\n22\nReverse polarity\n23 to 30\nReserved\n31\nFailure mode not available\n3.2.5.9\nReporting multiple failures\nA device is able to implement multiple functions, multiple instances of a single function, or a combination thereof. Such a device\nmay have multiple errors at the very same time; a separate DM_RV for each function or for each instance shall be sent by the\ndevice.\nA device with multiple instances of the same function may broadcast faults either by sending a separate DM_RV for each\ninstance, or combining all faults in a multiple packet message.\nNOTE 1 - A device combining all faults in a multiple packet message is unable to signal the status of each instance\nindependently, because only one operating status byte is sent for the entire message. This is appropriate where the\ninstances are integral sub-system of the device. This is not appropriate where the instances have their own operating\nstatus.\nEXAMPLE - The legs of a transfer switch are instances, which are integral sub-systems of a device. An AC load\nswitching device has instances, where each instance has its own status.\nNOTE 2 - A diagnostic device has to be careful in deciding when a fault is no longer active, because of the ambiguity\ninherent in the handling of multiple instance devices. A device that transmits a DM_RV with both faults (Yellow and\nRed) set to zero and a particular DSA surely indicates that there are no faults for that function within the device. But\nthere may be another device with the same function. A second SPN -RV from the same device and function does not\nnecessarily mean the first fault is no longer active. Any diagnostic device that needs to track the appearance and\ndisappearance of faults have to take advantage of the 1000 ms update rate of the DM_RV. The device may have to use\na timer to track the last appearance of the fault and the last appearance of a DM_RV from the source device.\n3.2.5.10\nEncoding multiple faults in a multiple packet message\nAlthough similar protocols suggest using the multi-packet protocol when multiple faults are present, this practice has been\ndeprecated in RV-C. Table 3.2.5.10 defines the former practice for the benefit of designers for whom compatibility with older products\nis necessary. New designs should not use this format.\nWhen multiple faults are present in a product, a DM_RV shall be broadcast for each fault. This specifically allows the alarm level\n(red, yellow) to be communicated for each SPN/FMI combination, which is often essential for proper analysis. Each transmission\nshall be repeated every 5000ms while the fault is active.\nA device with multiple faults from the same DSA may signal the faults using a multiple packet message. In this case the SPN,\nFMI and occurrence count shall be transmitted for each subsequent fault. The operating status and DSA shall be sent once and\nshall apply to all encoded faults.\nThe use of a multiple packet message is optional. It is defined in Table 3.2.5.10. All attributes not listed shall be identical to the\nactive diagnostic message (see 3.2.5.1b).\n(DEPRECATED) Table 3.2.5.10 \u2014 Signal and parameter definition (DEPRECATED)\nByte\nBit\nName\nData type\nUnit\nValue definition\nNovember 6, 2023\n3.2.5.10 -  Encoding multiple faults in a multiple packet message\n\n\u00a9 RVIA\nRV-C\n24\n0\n-\nOperating Status\nuint8\n-\nsee 3.2.5.2\n1\n-\nDSA\nuint8\n-\nsee 3.2.5.4\nFirst fault\n2\n-\nSPN-MSB\nuint8\n-\nsee 3.2.5.5\n3\n-\nSPN-ISB\nuint8\n-\nsee 3.2.5.5\n4\n5 to 7\nSPN-LSB\nuint3\n-\nsee 3.2.5.5\n0 to 4\nFMI\nuint5\n-\nsee 3.2.5.8\n5\n0 to 6\nOccurrence count\nuint7\n-\n7Fh if not available\n7\nreserved\n-\n-\nAlways 1\n6\n-\nDSA extension\nuint8\n-\nFFh \u2014 No DSA extension defined for product\nSecond Fault\n7\n-\nSPN-MSB\nuint8\n-\nsee 3.2.5.5\n8\n-\nSPN-ISB\nuint8\n-\nsee 3.2.5.5\n9\n5 to 7\nSPN-LSB\nuint3\n-\nsee 3.2.5.5\n0 to 4\nFMI\nuint5\n-\nsee 3.2.5.8\n10\n0 to 6\nOccurrence count\nuint7\n-\n7Fh if not available\n7\nreserved\n-\n-\nalways 1\n11\n-\nDSA extension\nuint8\n-\nFFh \u2014 No DSA extension defined for product\nSubsequent faults\nn\n-\nSPN-MSB\nuint8\n-\nsee 3.2.5.5\nn+1\n-\nSPN-ISB\nuint8\n-\nsee 3.2.5.5\nn+2\n5 to 7\nSPN-LSB\nuint3\n-\nsee 3.2.5.5\n0 to 4\nFMI\nuint5\n-\nsee 3.2.5.8\nn+3\n0 to 6\nOccurrence count\nuint7\n-\n7Fh if not available\n7\nreserved\n-\n-\nalways 1\nn+4\n-\nDSA extension\nuint8\n-\nFFh \u2014 No DSA extension defined for product\n3.2.6\nProprietary messages\nRV-C supports proprietary messages.

Although it is possible to use this message to implement functionality without publishing the\nmethod, this technique is to be used only when the desired function is not supported in the published protocol.\n3.2.7\nMulti packet message\nData groups longer than eight bytes shall be sent using the multi-packet message protocol, which allows messages up to 1785\nbytes. Each 'long message' is identified with a particular DGN, but the DGN definition is no longer limited to 8 data bytes. The\nmethod uses an initial packet to set up the transfer, followed by up to 255 data packets.\nThis technique has several severe limitations. There are no provisions for flow control. The receiving nodes do not communicate\ntheir readiness to receive data. The transmitter has no assurance that the data is being processed. There is no method for a\nreceiver to request a specific packet. If the entire DGN is not received correctly the receiving node shall request the entire DGN\nagain. A node shall only transmit one long message at a time, since data packets are not specifically identified in any way other\nthan the packet number. And long messages are relatively slow, because of the 50 ms gap between data packets. Therefore long\nmessages shall not be used for control and instrumentation purposes.\nLong messages are implicitly required for the PRODUCT_ID, and are optionally used for the DM_RV DGN when multiple faults\nare active. They are used rarely in the Application profile; generally for configuration purposes where substantial tables have to\nbe downloaded or uploaded.\n3.2.7.1\nInitial packet message\nTable 3.2.7.1a defines the DG definition and Table 3.2.7.1b defines the signal and parameter definition for the initial packet\nmessage.\nTable 3.2.7.1a - DG definition\nDG attribute\nValue\nName\nINITIAL_PACKET\nDGN\nECFFh\nDefault priority\nPer Encapsulated DGN\nMaximum broadcast gap\nN/A\nNormal broadcast gap\nPer Encapsulated DGN\nMinimum broadcast gap\n50 ms, see 3.2.4.2\nNumber of frames\n1\nACK requirements\nNone\nTable 3.2.7.1b - Signal and parameter definition\nByte\nBit\nName\nData Type\nUnit\nValue definition\n0\n-\nreserved\nuint8\n-\nalways 20h\n1,2\n-\nMessage length\nuint16\nbytes\nValue range = 0 to 1785\n3\n-\nPacket count\nuint8\npackets\nFFh \u2014 255 packets\nNote:\nUnlike most data fields, a FFh in\nthis position is to be parsed and interpreted as\n255 packets.\n5\n-\nDGN\nuint8\n-\nDGN transmitted (LSB)\n6\n-\nDGN\nuint8\n-\nDGN transmitted (ISB)\n7\n-\nDGN\nuint8\n-\nDGN transmitted (MSB)\nNovember 6, 2023\n3.2.7.1 -  Initial packet message\n\n\u00a9 RVIA\nRV-C\n26\n3.2.7.2\nSubsequent packet message\nTable 3.2.7.2a defines the DG definition and Table 3.2.7.2b defines the signal and parameter definition for the subsequent packet\nmessage.

Every RV-C node shall be able to\nrespond to the address request message with an address claimed message. RV-C nodes that are \"hard wired\" to an SA shall\nrespond to the address request in order to prevent a dynamically addressed RV-C node from taking its address. A dynamically\naddressed RV-C node will try addresses until it finds one unclaimed. Once it finds an unclaimed address, it sends the address\nclaimed message.\nTable 3.3.2a defines the address request message.\nTable 3.3.2a - Address request message\nAttribute\nValue definition\nDGN\nEA00h\nDGN-High\nEAh\nDGN-Low\nAddress desired\nPriority:\n6\nData length\n8 bytes\nBroadcast gap\nAs needed\nSource address\n254 (no address has been claimed)\nData 0\n0\nData 1\n238\nData 2\n0\nNOTE\nIt will be seen that that this is just an ordinary request for DGN\nEE00h, but directed at a particular address.\nTable 3.3.2b defines the address claimed message.\nTable 3.3.2b - Address claimed\nAttribute\nValue definition\nDGN\nEE00h\nDGN-High\nEEh\nDGN-Low\n00h\nPriority\n6\nBroadcast gap\nOn request only\nSource address\nAssigned SA\nData 0 to 7\n\"ADDRESS_CLAIM\" (8-byte identifier,\nsee clause 3.3.3)\nNovember 6, 2023",

In most cases, RV-C nodes should start with the address given for one of its RV-\nC device types in Table 7.2. The RV-C node shall not attempt to claim an address that might be used by a statically addressed\nRV-C node. If an address is already claimed, the RV-C node shall try the next address lower, and thus count downwards.\nIn rare cases a manufacturer may know that many of its nodes for which the same preferred dynamic address range applies will\nbe regularly installed on the same RV-C network. In order to reduce network traffic at startup, the manufacturer may choose to\nhave its nodes begin address claiming at a lower point in the preferred dynamic address range as opposed to the highest value.\nFor instance, if a vendor of RV-C window shades (preferred dynamic address range 128-143) sells a package that implements\nmore than a dozen nodes, each requiring its own source address, they may design their nodes so that the first begins address\nclaiming at 140, the second begins claiming at 139, the third at 138, and so on.\nThe ADDRESS_CLAIM field as described in Section 3.3.3 is used to determine the priority of RV-C nodes in address claiming.\nRV-C nodes with a higher priority ADDRESS_CLAIM field may \"take\" an address from a lower priority RV-C node, though it is\nacceptable for manufacturers to choose to avoid this practice (for example, they may choose to avoid \u201ctaking\u201d the addresses of\nlower priority nodes except when all other addresses in the preferred range are in use). Statically addressed RV-C nodes may\nkeep their address. Dynamically addressed RV-C nodes shall yield to static RV-C nodes, or to dynamic RV-C nodes with a higher\npriority ADDRESS_CLAIM field .\nAn RV-C node with dynamic addresses shall monitor network traffic and if they see another RV-C node using its address and it\nhas a higher priority ADDRESS_CLAIM field it shall automatically run through the procedure and claim a new address.\n3.3.3\nADDRESS_CLAIM field\nThe ADDRESS_CLAIM field is used as a method of uniquely identifying RV-C nodes during the address claiming procedure and\nfor network troubleshooting. When two or more nodes attempt to claim the same source address, the ADDRESS_CLAIM field is\nused for arbitration. The ADDRESS_CLAIM field should be treated as an eight byte value with the \u201cArbitrary Address Capable\u201d\nbit being the most significant bit. This ensures statically addressed nodes will always have the highest priority.\nThe ADDRESS_CLAIM field is defined in Table 3.3.3.\nTable 3.3.3: ADDRESS_CLAIM field\nByte\nBit\nName\nDescription\n0\n0 to 7\nSerial number (LSB)\nOptional.

The response may be a status\nmessage or a ACK/NAK, per the\nrequirements of the command/request.\n01A-S-16\nNAK\nA command which cannot be fulfilled\nis broadcast to the product.

For example, an awning shall process\nAWNING_COMMAND and report AWNING_STATUS DGNs, rather than DC_MOTOR_CONTROL_COMMAND/STATUS or other\nmessages. It shall use the Awning DSA rather than the DC Motor Control DSA.\nWhere a device type has not been defined for the product's purpose, it is acceptable to use a generic type such as DC Motor,\nGeneric AC Source, and Generic DC Load. Note that the Generic AC Load and Generic DC Load are also used for load\nmanagement, and it is acceptable for a product to use the associated DGNs (e.g. AC_LOAD_STATUS) for this purpose in\nNovember 6, 2023\n4.4.1.1 -  Use of Appropriate DGNs per Device Type\n\n\u00a9 RVIA\nRV-C\n36\naddition to the DGNs designated for their type. It is noted that new device types may be added to the protocol at any time, and a\nreasonable amount of time must be allowed for vendors to update their product. Moreover, backwards compatibility of products is\ndesirable, that is, new products may need to be able to inter-operate with older products that predate the change in protocol.\nTherefore there are two principle exceptions to the general rule.\n1. Products shall have a two year \u201cgrace period\u201d from the time of adoption of the new device type in the protocol to\nimplement the new DSA and DGNs.\n2. Products may respond to generic messages from complementary devices and broadcast using the corresponding\nDGNs, as long as the product also supports the new DSA and DGNs. It shall always use the new DSA.\nTo clarify, suppose hypothetically that a vendor introduced a Coffee Warmer, which it implements as a Generic AC Load. A few\nyears later, a Coffee Warmer device type is added to the protocol, along with COFFEE_WARMER_STATUS and\nCOFFER_WARMER_COMMAND DGNs. The vendor has two years to transition to the new DSA and DGNs. After that deadline,\nthe product may continue to accept AC_LOAD_COMMAND's and respond with AC_LOAD_STATUS, thus allowing the product to\nbe a direct service replacement for older RVs, but it must also support the new DGNs and DSA in parallel.\n4.4.1.2\nInappropriate Limits on Interoperability\nDevices shall not place limits on the use of standard commands in ordinary operation. When receiving any standard command,\nthe device shall process the command with no regard to the source. Proprietary messages shall not used as a mechanism for\nlimiting interoperability in ordinary operation. This does not apply to configuration, diagnostic, recovery, or test operations. This\nrule implies that all safety interlocks shall be implemented locally by the device, and not at the control panel or other\ncommanding device.\n4.4.1.3\nInappropriate Use of Proprietary Messages\nProprietary messages shall be used only in a service context and not in ordinary operation. The\nDEVICE_STATE_SYNCHRONIZATION message shall only be used when active synchronization is required. The contents of the\nmessage shall conform to documentation supplied by the vendor.\n4.4.1.4\nDocumented Diagnostics\nDevices shall use the DM-RV to report all diagnostic conditions. Diagnostic codes shall be as precise as reasonably possible,\nusing documented SPNs. If any fault requires specific acknowledgment to \u201cclear\u201d (for example, a short circuit has been detected\nand the unit does not want to energize the circuit until the short has been fixed), the product shall support the Clear Faults flag in\nthe GENERAL_RESET DGN for this purpose.\n4.4.1.5\nDocumented Alarms\nAlarm events shall be communicated using the GENERIC_ALARM DGN, using standard codes when available. Proprietary\nalarm instances shall be documented.\n4.4.1.6\nMeaningful NAKs\nWhen a device receives a commands that it cannot immediately fulfill, it shall respond with a NAK which includes an appropriate\ncode describing the failure. When the command is fulfilled, it shall transmit the appropriate STATUS message.\n4.4.1.7\nTransparency of Control Activity\nDevices that have methods of control that are independent of RV-C shall report their status regardless of the control source. For\nexample, an awning that has a set of switches connected directly to its circuitry shall report its motion and position via RV-C even\nwhen the motion is due to the use of the direct switches. Devices shall accept RV-C commands for the same operations without\ninappropriate limits, per section 4 - Conformance requirements.\n4.4.2\nProfile 02A: Level Two Compliance\nPrerequisite: Profile 01A-Level One Compliance.\nThe Level Two profile is independent of all Level Three profiles. Certain tests within this profile require the vendor to provide the\nmeans of testing all RV-C functions. In all such cases, \u201call functions\u201d means \u201call functions and feature supported by the product\u201d,\nregardless of whether the function or feature is part of a Level Three profile for which the product is claiming compliance, or any\nNovember 6, 2023",

Therefore, filling in\nunused fields with maximum values (e.g. FFh for a eight-bit field, 11b for a two-bit field) is always safe, and devices shall ignore\nthose fields when parsing the message.

It serves as a heartbeat to show that the device exists on the network. It includes the DSA\n(see table 3.2a) field indicating the device type being reported on, which is often critical for the correct operation of other devices.\nAnd it gives an indication of the device's operating status. Therefore, broadcasting the DM-RV on schedule is critical. If no faults\nare active, fill in the SPN and FMI fields with 7FFFFh and 1Fh values, respectively.\n4.5.4\nSend DM-RVs for each supported device type\nIt is not unusual for a node to support multiple device types (see table 3.2a) - e.g. Generator and AutoGenStart, or Furnace and\nThermostat. If so, send a DM-RV for each device type. This is essential for diagnostics and in some case, product\ninteroperability.  If a node supports multiple instances of a device type it should not broadcast a DMRV for each instance \u2013 e.g. a\nnode supporting three slide room instances would only broadcast a single DMRV with the DSA for slide rooms.\n4.5.5\nEncode values in Little-Endian format\nBe aware whether your microprocessor and its toolchain process 16-bit and 32-bit values in \"Big-Endian\" or \"Little-Endian\" form.\nRV-C uses Little-Endian encoding except where specifically noted, and if your environment is Big-Endian you may need some\nextra code to convert multi-byte values accordingly.\n4.5.6\nMaintain a gap between messages\nIt is often the case that a device has a significant number of messages transmitted on the same schedule or in response to the\nsame DGN request - for example, a transfer switch has multiple legs to report upon every 500ms, each requires several\nmessages. If all of these messages are sent in immediate order, with no gap between, other devices may see their CAN buffers\noverflow and messages get dropped. The general rule is that a device should maintain a 50ms gap between messages. It is\nacceptable to reduce this gap if the number of messages a device is required to send in a particular interval requires it, but the\ngap should not be reduced any further than necessary. It is also acceptable to temporarily reduce the gap in a service context,\nsuch as a firmware download or diagnostic test.\nNovember 6, 2023",

In such cases, the following method for reporting is recommended.\nFirst, note that 0 always means Off (or the equivalent). Other values are divided as equally as possible among the possible\nstates. Thus a two-stage fan would consider values from 1-100 (50%) as \"Low\" and 101-200 (100%) as \"High\". A three-stage fan\nwould use 1-66 (33%) as \"Low\", 67-133 (66.5%) as \"Medium\", and 134-200 (100%) as \"High\". A five-stage fan would use\nintervals of 1-40, 41-80, 81-120, 121-160, and 161-200.\nWhen reporting the status, the device should use the highest value in the applicable range. e.g. For a three-stage fan, 0, 66, 133,\nand 200. When parsing commands, it should accept any value in the range. e.g. If the three-stage fan receives a command to go\nto 100 (50%), it would consider this \"Medium\" and report a speed of 133.\nThis scheme assumes that the steps or levels are evenly distributed along the spectrum from Off to 100% On. If the steps are\nnot reasonably uniform, a more precise representation of the values is recommended.\nNovember 6, 2023",

Some aspects of Instance Assignment is necessarily\nproprietary, and specific product knowledge is generally required to use these DGNs.\nBoth DGNs are destination-specific. The DGN-Low of the DGN indicates the source address of the target of the message.\nTable 6.2.4a \u2013 DG Definition\nDG Attribute\nValue\nName\nINSTANCE_ASSIGNMENT\nDGN\n17C00\nDGN-Low = Destination Address.

For example, a climate control device may include a thermostat, air\nconditioners, and furnace instances that might be assigned independently. This would require multiple uses of this DGN, with\ndifferent DSA values for each device type.\nIf a device supports multiple instances of a particular type, it may be configured in one of two ways. If a contiguous block of\ninstances is desired, the Base and Max Instance fields define the block. Or, the instances can be assigned one at a time by\nsetting the Max Instance field to 255 (FFh), or equal to the Base Instance.\nThe most common use of this DGN is to assign Instances to a device.

For example, to assign climate control zones to a\nNovember 6, 2023\nSection: 6.2.4 -  Instance Assignment\n\n\u00a9 RVIA\nRV-C\n53\nthermostat. It can also be used to set the Instance values used in commands sent by a control panel, or Instances monitored by\na display or control. The format does not change, even though conceptually the two cases are diametrically opposite. For\nexample, a keypad might be configurable to control an Awning. This DGN can be used to set which Awning Instance the keypad\nshall control.\nThe Internal Address fields are defined by the node designer. If the device supports only a single instance of the indicated type\nthese fields could be left blank (i.e. FFhFF) at the option of the node designer. If the device supports multiple instances of the\nindicated type, these fields identify how the RV-C Instance will be mapped to the internal resource. It cannot be assumed that the\nInternal Addresses follow any particular numbering scheme. The Internal Address could be from a numeric sequence, but they\ncould be a memory address, resource identifier, or table index. Their interpretation is a proprietary feature of the device.\nAs an example, consider a keypad (with source address A0) that is programmed to control four DC loads, an awning, and a\ngenerator. The designer has chosen to maintain the configuration information in a serial EEPROM, which is addressed by the bit.\nFor programming convenience the designer has chosen to make the Internal Address value correspond to the actual bit\naddresses in the EEPROM. The first 32 bits are used for the door lock Instance values, the next 8 bits are used for the awning\nInstance values. Since the Generator is not an instanced device, no memory is required nor any configuration message.\nThen the following messages would assign the DC Loads (DSA 92) to a block from 4 to 7, and the Awning (DSA 0x82) to\nInstance 3. (All data values are in hexadecimal.)\nDGN: 17CA0 Data: 92 04 07 00 00 1F 00 FF (DC Loads 4-7 at addresses 0-31)\nDGN: 17CA0 Data: 82 03 FF 20 00 FF FF FF (Awning 3 at address 32)\nThe node designer could have defined the Internal Address differently, and in the case of the Awning Instance eliminated the field\naltogether.\nIf a Base Instance and/or Max Instance is indicated, the INSTANCE_STATUS shall report the instance data for the indicated\nInstances. If no Base Instance is indicated, one or more INSTANCE_STATUS packets shall be broadcast indicating the status of\nall Instances of that type.\nTable 6.2.4c \u2013 DG Attributes\nDG Attribute\nValue\nName\nINSTANCE_STATUS\nDGN\n17B00\nDGN-Low = Destination Address.

It may also utilize\nanother source of DC power, such as a fuel cell, another DC Source / bus, or a combination of sources such as multiple battery\npacks and related monitoring devices such as an SOC meter or BMS. These DGs are not specifically associated with any\nparticular product and may be broadcast by any device that monitors the condition of the associative DC Source. This could be a\nbattery monitoring node (BMS/SOC meter), a charger, or some other node with sufficient capabilities to appropriately report the\nstatus of a given DC Source.\nDC Source messages provide for the ability to report the status as well as charging needs (in the case of batteries) and may be\nimplemented in one of three levels of sophistication: Basic, Reporting, or Managed. See section 6.5.23 for additional details and\nrequirements for each of these levels. Only the highest priority (which is presumably the most accurate) such device should be\nbroadcasting the DGN at any given time. The following formats apply (see Table 6.5.1).\nTable 6.5.1 \u2014 DC source definition\nDevice attribute\nValue\nCategory\nMulti-source DG format\nDefault Source Address\nN/A\nDynamic Address Range\nN/A\nInstance\nMulti-instance\nDC Source uses the concept of node priority. Only the highest priority node (which is presumably the most accurate) should be\nbroadcasting the DGNs at any given time. At any given time all DC Source DGNs must come from one device. When a DC\nmonitoring device initiates on the network, it should wait 2 seconds before beginning transmission of these message types. If a\nhigher priority device is transmitting these DGNs for the same DC-Source instance, the new device should not transmit. After a\nperiod of no transmission of these DGNs by any higher priority node is noted, the device may begin transmission.\nWhile transmitting these DGNs, if another device of higher priority begins transmission, the lower priority device should stop\ntransmission and at the same time consumers of these messages should ignore the lower priority messages. Even if a node\ndoes not support all DC Source DGNs, if it is the highest priority node it shall be the only node broadcasting - even if another\nnode supports the missing DGN. This ensures that all the DC Source information currently being broadcast is coming from the\nsame measuring source. And as a result, devices with limited instrumentation capabilities should refrain from assuming the role\nof transmitting or be assigned a low priority.\nIf two devices have the same published priority, the device with the higher CAN source address shall have priority.\nIt is possible for more than one DC_Instance to be physically connected to the same physical power bus. And example, one bank\nof batteries in the front of a vehicle, with an additional bank in the rear engine compartment \u2013 both being connected to the same\nDC \u201cHouse\u201d power bus. In such a case an aggregation function shall be utilized to provide a consolidated, or aggregated view\nwith a unique DC Instance. In most cases other devices will interact with the DC SOURCE using this aggregated view, and a\nsuch will be associated with the same aggregated DC Instance. Each individual DC SOURCE may in addition optionally report its\nown status via a separate DC_SOURCE Instance number in which case the DC_ SOURCE_CONNECTION_STATUS DGN\nusing the relevant DSA (Battery DSA in this example) would be used to indicate linkage between individual DC_SOURCES and\nthe aggregated view.\nA global request for these DGNs should trigger all measurement devices that support the DGN to transmit, regardless of whether\nthey are the current \u201cmaster\u201d.\nNovember 6, 2023",

Though the use of DC SOURCE, RV-C\nallows for well coordinated management of batteries and their associated charging sources to assure all are working towards the\nsame goal, implement prioritization of charging resource to optimize operational costs, as well as provide for installation\nsimplification through remote instrumentation.\nThe following profiles (Basic, Reporting, Managed) define three different levels of sophistication that DC Sources may offer, each\ndelivering additional values to the rest of the RV-C installation and allowing for simple deployments to complex highly integrated\nDC systems.\nNote that in all cases Instance and Priority MUST be included where noted in DC_SOURCE_xx messages. Also a general note,\nsome DC Source devices feature internal disconnects for the charge and/or load bus.

The Source Address must be\nexamined to identify the sender.\n6.6.2\nCommunication Status 1\nTable 6.6.2a defines the DG attributes, and Table 6.6.2b defines the signal and parameter attributes.

This will make it easier to provide multi-purpose service and configuration tools. The following formats\napply (see Table 6.7.1).\nTable 6.7.1 \u2014 Proprietary DGNs definition\nDevice attribute\nValue\nCategory\nSpecial\nDefault Source Address\nN/A\nDynamic Address Range\nN/A\nInstance\nN/A\n6.7.2\nPassword Validation\nSome operations may require a password before access will be granted to certain features. When a node refuses a command\ndue to lack of authorization, the recipient shall send a Proprietary DGN (DGN_High = 239, DGN_Low = Destination Address)\nwith the first byte set to 0 and the other bytes set to 255.\nThe node shall respond with an eight-byte \"challenge\", again using the Proprietary DGN with the Destination being the Source\nAddress of the node attempting the control. The data bytes in this challenge may be pseudo-random numbers. The controlling\nnode then shall send a \"response\". The response shall be a packet with the first byte set to 0, and the rest of the packet\nconsisting of values determined by the challenge . The node then shall respond with an ACK, with the ACK value indicating\nwhether the password was accepted.\nBy using a challenge-response system, it makes it very difficult for a third node listening in to determine the formula for the\npassword. Even a simple combination of XOR masks and bit shifts would require observing a huge number of transactions to\ndecipher. More elaborate formulae are possible, including virtually unbreakable public-key schemes.\n6.7.3\nInstance and Address Assignment\nThe configuration of many types of nodes includes the assignment of Instance codes and source addresses.\nTable 6.7.3a defines the DG attributes, and Table 6.7.3b defines the signal and parameter attributes. All counts are from node\npower-on. The first byte contains a mode value for determining how the remaining bytes are to be interpreted.\nTable 6.7.3a \u2014 DG definition\nDG attribute\nValue\nName\nSpecial Application \u2013 proprietary DGN\nNovember 6, 2023",

Although SAE\nJ1939 offers some of this functionality of these DGs, it does not include a way to immobilize the chassis, and is not universally\navailable. More detailed information on chassis components such as the engine and transmission should be handled through\nSAE J1939 emulation.

First, the device should issue this command before extending and must monitor for the acknowledgment. Secondly,\nthe device must respond to any request for this DGN, and properly report whether it still wants the chassis system locked. Third,\nit should send the command again to unlock the chassis after retracting. (The same principle applies to the other interlocks\nsupported here).\nThe device implementing the DG should monitor the incoming commands and keep a list of devices that have requested a lock.\nBefore releasing a lock, it should broadcast a request for this DGN and compare the results with the list in memory. The chassis\ndevice shall be careful not to completely trust either method - a locking device may be off-line, and thus not respond to the\nrequest for the DGN or fail to send the unlocking command.\nTable 6.11.4a defines the DG attributes, and Table 6.11.4b defines the signal and parameter attributes.\nTable 6.11.4a \u2014 DG definition\nDG attribute\nValue\nName\nCHASSIS_MOBILITY_COMMAND\nDGN\n1FFF3h\nDefault priority\n4\nMaximum broadcast gap\nN/A\nNormal broadcast gap\nas needed\nMinimum broadcast gap\n500 ms\nNumber of frames\n1\nACK requirements\nNone\nTable 6.11.4b \u2014 Signal and parameter definition\nByte\nBit\nName\nData Type\nUnit\nValue definition\nNovember 6, 2023",

This description shall be included in the approval documentation\nand available for examination.\nSimulation methods may include:\nDiscrete Signal Input. Typically an Active High (12v) or Active Low (Ground) signal. The interpretation of the signal must be\ndocumented. (e.g. whether an active value means \u201cOn\u201d or \u201cOff\u201d.) The test shall use a signal of like type.\nAnalog Signal Input. Typically a resistance (e.g. 0-90 ohms) or voltage (e.g. 0-5V) signal. The full interpretation of the signal must\nbe documented. The test shall use a signal of like type.\nSAE J1939 Data Item. A datum from the SAE J1939 data bus. The specific message DGN and data byte/bits must be\ndocumented. A simulated SAE J1939 data bus shall be used for testing.\nAdvanced Sensors. Examples include accelerometers and GPS. It may not be practical to test these under lab conditions. If so,\nfor testing the applicant may supply a version in which the actual sensor readings are \u201cspoofed\u201d to simulate typical operation.\nProducts may support more than one means of simulating an input or operation, in which case each method documented shall\nbe tested. For example, the park brake status may be an Active High input, an Active Low input, or a SAE J1939 data item. In no\ncase should an item be documented in the submission without being tested.\nNote that these tests do not affirm compliance to the SAE J1939 specification, compatibility with any particular chassis, or\nproduct performance.

This\n\u201cpassive\u201d approach can be applied to any datum in the DGN. The tests for compliance for any of data items implemented in this\nway share the same general structure. Most require three tests. The first test, labeled 252V*-S-01, begins with the product in a\ndefault state. A second state is triggered or simulated by some means, and then a third state (which may be the default state) is\ntriggered or simulated. With each of the two changes in state, the VEHICLE_ENVIRONMENT_STATUS is broadcast within\n500ms with the indicated datum, and GENERIC_ALARM_STATUS is broadcast with the indicated alarm.\nThe second test (not shared by all profiles) checks the behavior as the vehicle is in motion. Test 252V*-S-02 begins with the\nproduct in a default state. RV motion is then simulated, which triggers VEHICLE_ENVIRONMENT_STATUS within 500ms, and\nmay trigger a GENERIC_ALARM. Motion then ends, which triggers VEHICLE_ENVIRONMENT_STATUS again.\nTest 252V*-S-03 (not shared by all profiles) tests behavior when the vehicle is in motion. The test begins with the vehicle in\nsimulated motion. VEHICLE_ENVIRONMENT_COMMAND is then sent with the indicated value. The device should respond with\nNovember 6, 2023\n6.11.9.2 -  Vehicle Environment Base Test Profile:\n\n\u00a9 RVIA\nRV-C\n110\na NAK-3 (Conditions Do Not Allow).\nThe applicant must specify a means of simulating vehicle motion. Possibilities include receiving CHASSIS_MOBILITY_STATUS\nor any of the simulation methods listed in the section above. The method of simulation must be documented as part of the\nsubmission.\nThis profile is a prerequisite for all profiles 252V*. It ensures that the device does not broadcast an excessive number of\nmessages when multiple fields are changing in rapid order, as may happen when the RV goes into motion or is parked.\nID\nDatum\nTest\nRequired Response\nVehicle Environment\nCommand\nSend updated status of system with\nattached sensor\nIf sensor information does not contradict\nthe command report appropriate status.\n252V-S-01\nVEHICLE_ENVIRONM\nENT_STATUS\nA series of\nVEHICLE_ENVIRONMENT_COMMAND\nmessages are sent, 50ms apart, each\ncontaining a different field from the\nmessage previous (unless the device\nonly supports one message).

The addressing of the jacks or bags follows the convention in\nLEVELING_CONTROL_COMMAND. Note that the Air and Hydraulic levelers share this DGN when reporting their status. The\nfirst byte indicates whether the Lower/Raise operations in subsequent bytes refer to air or hydraulic actions.

These correspond to \u201czones\u201d\nin the general terminology. There is no set definition for the location of each zone in a coach.\nThe furnace generally operates in an \u201cautomatic\u201d mode, consulting the thermostat assigned to the same Instance for the\nnecessary temperature and user input data. The mode may be overridden for diagnostic purposes, or as part of a larger climate\ncontrol scheme.\nSystems that use multiple heat exchangers with a single combustion unit should report as multiple instances. Each heat\nexchanger reports as a \u201cfurnace\u201d, with the fan speed set appropriately and the heat output level being that of the central\ncombustion unit. Commands to set the heat output level for any instance should be applied to the central unit.\n6.15.2\nFurnace Status\nThis is the general furnace status DGN.

It is often integrated into a climate control device such as an air\nconditioner, and even if it is a standalone device, it may be a completely passive device that exists solely to store information\nregarding the desires of the operator.\nA thermostat typically has a temperature sensor attached, and a thermostat device may have no other function than to report a\ntemperature. However, it is possible for a thermostat to rely on a second thermostat for the temperature reading, in which case it\nshall echo the remote reading as though the reading came from an integrated sensor.\nNote that a single physical thermostat may implement multiple thermostat Instances.\nAlthough it may be convenient for the Instances of the thermostat to match the Instances of the Air Conditioners and Furnaces\nthat it may control, this is not an absolute requirement. It is entirely possible - though confusing - for a climate control system to\nhave completely different Instance numbers for every component - temperature sensors (which are treated as thermostats with\nonly one function), thermostats, air conditioners, furnaces, etc.\nThe Instances correspond directly to the Instances of the furnace and air conditioners.

If Schedule Mode is Enabled while the setpoint is manually\nadjusted, the setpoint will change with the next scheduled change. If Schedule Mode is Disabled, then the setpoint will not\nchange. Some thermostats may automatically revert to the original setpoint after a period of time. This behavior is not specifically\naddressed in this DGN.\nTo put the thermostat in a \u201cStorage\u201d mode, this DGN should be used in conjunction with THERMOSTAT_COMMAND_1 and the\nSchedule Mode should be set to Disabled. To force the thermostat to resume the scheduled mode the Current Schedule Instance\nshould be set to 251. For example, when bringing the thermostat out of Storage (Instance 250), the Instance should be set to\n251. The thermostat should check its schedule and choose the appropriate Instance (e.g. \u201cWake\u201d) accordingly.

Note that each \u201cZone\u201d Instance may have several\nSchedule Instances.\nThere is no specific process to coordinate the schedules across multiple zones. If a single thermostat handles all zones, it is the\ndesigner's decision whether to have all zones follow the same schedule. If there are multiple thermostats, each will have its own\nschedule.\nSchedule Instances indicate that specific changes in set points will occur at specific times. Although terminology such as \u201cSleep\u201d\nand \u201cWake\u201d are defined, there is no enforcement of these conventions. There are no provisions for adjusting the schedule for the\nday of the week. If the user desired to have a different schedule for Saturday than for the rest of the week, different Instances\nmust be programmed for that day.\nA request for these DGNs should result in the reporting of all Schedule Instances available for the device.\n6.16.7\nThermostat Schedule Status 1\nTable 6.16.7a defines the DG attributes, and Table 6.16.7b defines the signal and parameter attributes.\nTable 6.16.7a \u2014 DG definition\nDG attribute\nValue\nName\nTHERMOSTAT_SCHEDULE_STATUS_1\nDGN\n1FEF7h\nDefault priority\n6\nMaximum broadcast gap\nN/A\nNormal broadcast gap\non change\nMinimum broadcast gap\n500 ms\nNumber of frames\n1\nACK requirements\nNone\nTable 6.16.7b \u2014 Signal and parameter definition\nByte\nBit\nName\nData type\nUnit\nValue definition\n0\n-\nInstance\nuint8\n-\nsee Table 5.3\nCorresponds to \u201cZones\u201d in user terminology.\n1\n-\nSchedule mode instance\nuint8\n-\n0 \u2014 \u201cSleep\u201d\n1 \u2014 \u201cWake\u201d\n2 \u2014 \u201cAway\u201d\n3 \u2014 \u201cReturn\u201d\n4 to 249 \u2014 Additional Instances\n250 \u2014 Storage\n2\n-\nStart hour\nuint8\nh\nPrecision = 1 h\nValue range = 0 to 23\n0 - 12:00 AM\n12 \u2013 12:00 Noon\n23 \u2013 11:00 PM\nThis shall be in Local Time\n3\n-\nStart minute\nuint8\nmin\nPrecision = 1 min\nValue range = 0 to 59\n4 to 5\n-\nSetpoint temp - Heat\nuint16\nDeg C\nsee Table 5.3\n6 to 7\n-\nSetpoint temp - Cool\nuint16\nDeg C\nsee Table 5.3\n6.16.8\nThermostat Schedule Status 2\nNovember 6, 2023",

Like the\nfurnace, the AC monitors the output of the thermostat to determine whether to blow, heat, or cool. The Instance corresponds to\nthe same Instances for the furnace and thermostat. Thus it is highly likely that there is an AC Instance 1 and a Furnace Instance\n1, which would roughly correspond to the same zone within the RV. The following formats apply (see Table 6.17.1).\nTable 6.17.1 \u2014 Air conditioner definition\nDevice attribute\nValue\nCategory\nComfort systems\nDefault Source Address\n103 to 106\nDynamic Address Range\n192 to 207\nInstance\nMultiple\nMultiple source addresses may be allocated, but thermostats are identified by the Instance in each DGN.

A Charger is a sophisticated version of the Converter, and typically includes such\nfeatures as multi-stage battery charging. It is often combined with an Inverter, in which case the node should support the Inverter\nDGNs as well. There may be more than one charger as two chargers are common.\nIn the case of a combination Inverter/Charger, the unit should use the same instance number for both. Due to the prevalence of\ncombination units, no Charger should share an instance with an Inverter unless they are a combination unit.\nNote that the DC Source Instance does not correspond to the Inverter or Charger Instance but rather indicates the DC\nsubsystem the charger is attached to and supporting. The following formats apply (see Table 6.20.1).\nTable 6.20.1 \u2014 Charger definition\nDevice attribute\nValue\nCategory\nPower components\nDefault Source Address\n74, 75\nDynamic Address Range\n128 to 143\nInstance\nMultiple\n6.20.2\nAC Status\nA charger will have AC inputs, which are reported using the same DGNs as the Inverter AC Status. If the charger is part of an\nInverter/Charger package, the AC Input can be the same as the Inverter AC Inputs. In this case the Instance could be the same.\nOtherwise, the Charger Instances should be unique among the Charger and Inverter AC Points. The Instance field is defined in\nthe same manner as the Inverter AC Instances.\nNovember 6, 2023",

The function of the circuit is not explicit in the DGN - there is generally no way to identify the\npurpose of a circuit in RV-C. As this DGN is for generic loads it may not be the most suitable for all DC loads. Please ensure that\na more suitable DGN is not available before using the Generic DC load DGN. The following formats apply (see Table 6.23.1).\nTable 6.23.1 \u2014 Generic DC load definition\nDevice attribute\nValue\nCategory\nPower components\nDefault Source Address\n146\nDynamic Address Range\n128 to 143\nInstance\nMultiple\nThe DGNs and schemes are identical to the AC Load DGNs. Each circuit is identified with an Instance from 1 to 250, which are\nindependent of the AC Instances.\nStatic addressing is discouraged in this product.\n6.23.2\nDC Load Status\nThis DGN should not be used with the Multi-Packet protocol. If multiple switches are to be reported, each should be reported in\nits own packet. Table 6.23.2 defines the DG attributes. The signal and parameter attributes are the same as AC_LOAD_STATUS\n(see Table 6.22.2b), including the group mechanism. Note that the groups are also independent of the AC Load groups.\nTable 6.23.2 \u2014 DG definition\nDG attribute\nValue\nName\nDC_LOAD_STATUS\nDGN\n1FFBDh\nDefault priority\n6\nMaximum broadcast gap\nN/A\nNormal broadcast gap\non change and periodically when active\nMinimum broadcast gap\n100ms\nNumber of frames\n1\nACK requirements\nNone\nTable 6.23.2a \u2013 Signal and parameter definition\nbyte\nBit\nName\nData type\nUnit\nValue description\nNovember 6, 2023",

In an \u201cactive\u201d implementation,\nthe switch node sends a DC_LOAD_COMMAND or similar command, directing the load with no intermediary. In a \u201cpassive\u201d\nimplementation, the switch sends an INPUT_STATUS DGN, which is read by the target device or an intermediary, and that\ndevice acts appropriately. Implementations may be mixed.

Table 6.28.2a defines the DG attributes and Table 6.28.2b defines the signal and parameter\nattributes.\nThe Relative Tank Level is reported as a fraction, thus communicating the precision with which the sensors should be reported.\nThis prevents a digital display from reporting \u201c87.5%\u201d and leaving the consumer with the impression of accuracy to three digits\nwhen the tank level sensor only reports in eighths.\nWhen this DGN is requested, the node shall send one packet for each existing tank. This will be done by sending separate\npackets, not by using the Multi -Packet protocol.\nTable 6.28.2a \u2014 DG definition\nDG attribute\nValue\nName\nTANK_STATUS\nDGN\n1FFB7h\nDefault priority\n6\nMaximum broadcast gap\n5000 ms\nNormal broadcast gap\non change\nMinimum broadcast gap\n500 ms\nNumber of frames\n1\nACK requirements\nNone\nTable 6.28.2b \u2014 Signal and parameter definition\nByte\nBit\nName\nData type\nUnit\nValue description\n0\n-\nInstance\nuint8\n-\n0 \u2014 Fresh water\nNovember 6, 2023",

Typically, the user would empty the tank\nand send this message with a level of zero, then fill the tank and send the message again with a level of \"full\". Some tanks may\nsupport calibrating to intermediate values, as well.\nTable 6.28.3a defines the DG attributes and Table 6.28.3b defines the signal and parameter attributes.\nTank systems that use this calibration method should automatically convert the precision values. For example, if Level = 1 and\nPrecision = 1, it should properly interpret this as 100% full, regardless of the inherent precision of the sensors.\nTable 6.28.3a \u2014 DG definition\nDG attribute\nValue\nName\nTANK_CALIBRATION_COMMAND\nDGN\n1FFB6h\nDefault priority\n6\nMaximum broadcast gap\nN/A\nNormal broadcast gap\nAs needed\nMinimum broadcast gap\nAs needed\nNumber of frames\n1\nACK requirements\nNAK, TANK_STATUS\nTable 6.28.3b \u2014 Signal and parameter definition\nByte\nBit\nName\nData type\nUnit\nValue description\n0\n-\nInstance\nuint8\n-\n0 \u2014 Fresh water\n1 \u2014 Black waste (If only one waste tank is\npresent, it shall be reported as Black.)\n2 \u2014 Gray waste\n3 \u2014 LPG\n16 \u2014 Second fresh water\n17 \u2014 Second black waste\n18 \u2014 Second gray waste\n19 \u2014 Second LPG\n1\n-\nRelative level\nuint8\n-\nLevel = Relative Level / Resolution\nNovember 6, 2023",

But not all tank systems will use these DGNs. This set of DGNs is used in\nconjunction with the Tank Geometry Configuration DGNs.\nTable 6.28.4a defines the DG attributes and Table 6.28.4b defines the signal and parameter attributes.\nThe report consists of a table of values, each entry of which corresponds to a specific tank level.

If additional output points\nare needed, then each should be considered a separate transfer switch. If only one transfer switch is installed, it should use a\ndefault Instance value of 1.

One set of DGNs should be sent for each line\nand leg. Of course, not all switches will support all DGNs - only the supported DGNs should be broadcast.\nThe active input line should be broadcast every 500 ms. The inactive inputs should only be broadcast every 5000 ms, or when\nthe DGN is requested.\nTable 6.32.2a defines the DG attributes and Table 6.32.2b defines the Byte[0] - Transfer Switch Instance field. The remaining\nfields for the four DGNs follow the format of the four AC Point Status DGNs.

Whereas it possible to start the generator by\nusing the GENERATOR_COMMAND DGN, there are no provisions within that DGN for dealing with multiple devices that wish to\ncontrol the generator. One device may shut down the generator even as another device needs it to be on. This is generally not\nacceptable.\nProducts that wish to control the generator should first check to see whether an Automatic Generator Start device is present. It\nshould only use the GENERATOR_COMMAND if no device supporting AUTO_GENERATOR_COMMAND is available. The\nfollowing formats apply (see Table 6.35.1).\nTable 6.35.1 \u2014 Device definition\nDevice attribute\nValue\nCategory\nPower components\nDefault Source Address\n65\nNovember 6, 2023",

First, it is a device similar in structure to the Chassis Mobility Control that maintains a list of\ndevices that desire the generator to be on. It turns the generator on and off according to demand. Secondly, it may have its own\ninternal criteria for starting and stopping the generator for a variety of purposes.\n6.35.2\nGenerator Demand Status\nThis DGN allows products to determine the status of generator demand. Note that this is not the same as generator run status -\nthe generator may be running or not, regardless of demand. This DGN also indicates whether there is demand for generator\npower from this system. The flags in the first byte indicate whether demand exists, and whether external activity is overriding the\ndemand. Generally an external stop should take precedence over the network or internal demand. Such a stop may be a manual\nstop, for example for service, or caused by a generator failure. This flag may be reset by the next DGN, or by some automatic\nmeans.\nTable 6.35.2a defines the DG attributes and Table 6.35.2b defines the signal and parameter attributes.\nTable 6.35.2a \u2014 DG definition\nDG attribute\nValue\nName\nGENERATOR_DEMAND_STATUS\nDGN\n1FF80h\nDefault priority\n6\nMaximum broadcast gap\n5000 ms\nNormal broadcast gap\non change\nMinimum broadcast gap\n500 ms\nNumber of frames\n1\nACK requirements\nNone\nTable 6.35.2b \u2014 Signal and parameter definition\nByte\nBit\nName\nData type\nUnit\nValue description\n0\n0 to 1\nGenerator demand\nuint2\n-\n00b - No demand for generator\n01b - Generator is demanded\n2 to 3\nInternal generator demand\nuint2\n-\n00b - No internal demand\n01b - Internal AGS criterion is\ndemanding generator\n4 to 5\nNetwork generator demand uint2\n-\n00b - No demand from other network nodes\n01b - Network device is demanding generator\n6 to 7\nExternal activity detected\nuint2\n-\n00b - Automatic starting is allowed\n01b - Automatic starting is disabled due to the\ndetection of external activity\n1\n0 to 1\nManual override detected\nuint2\n-\n00b - Normal Operation\n01b - Manual Override\n2 to 3\nQuiet time\nuint2\n-\n00b - Unit is not in Quiet Time\n01b - Unit is in Quiet Time\n4 to 5\nQuiet time override\nuint2\n-\n00b - Normal operation\n01b - Quiet Time is being overridden\nNovember 6, 2023",

Devices that use this DGN must also support the request for\nthis DGN. Before stopping the generator, the controller may poll devices for this DGN, and if any device indicates it demands\npower it should not stop the generator.\nNote that this DGN is not the same as GENERATOR_COMMAND. That DGN starts or stops the generator without regard to\nQuiet Time or other demands upon the generator. If this DGN is implemented in the network it should be used in preference to\nGENERATOR_COMMAND. That DGN should be used only for testing and by the AGS controller itself.\nThe AGS controller may also maintain a list of devices that have demanded power, and base its decision on that list rather than\npolling the network. Either scheme is acceptable in RV-C, so products may use either or both methods.\nTable 6.35.3a defines the DG attributes and Table 6.35.3b defines the signal and parameter attributes. If the AGS is in Quiet\nTime, the ACK should return a value of 3 (\u201cConditions do not allow command to be implemented\u201d). The use of NAK 7 (\u201cMore time\nrequired to reply\u201d) has been deprecated - formerly it could be used if the AGS is programmed to start the genset at the end of\nquiet time. If the AGS has detected external activity that takes precedence, then a value of 8 (\u201cUser override has priority\u201d) should\nbe returned. If the generator has a known fault, then it should return a 3.\nTable 6.35.3a \u2014 DG definition\nDG attribute\nValue\nName\nGENERATOR_DEMAND_COMMAND\nDGN\n1FEFFh\nDefault priority\n6\nMaximum broadcast gap\nN/A\nNormal broadcast gap\nAs needed\nNovember 6, 2023",

In the former case, to start or stop the generator is to send the RV-C command GENERATOR_COMMAND, with the\nappropriate value in the Command field. In the latter case, to start or stop the generator involves the direct physical control of\ngenerator components. In the latter case testing may be done with a simulated generator, as long as the simulator can simulate\nall conditions required in the tests.\nNote that the genset or AGS controller may have a built-in dwell time to prevent the rapid cycling of generator starts and stops.\nFor the purpose of these tests, this dwell time enforcement shall be disabled or the tests shall be timed to avoid conflicts with the\ndwell timer. Dwell support in the AGS controller is tested under its own test profile.\nIt is possible for an AGS controller to not implement any AGS Criteria - depending on networked sources entirely for demand\ntriggers. If the AGS controller implements any demand triggers internally, each trigger must satisfy at least an AGS Criterion\nprofile, supporting the AGS_CRITERION_COMMAND and _STATUS messages accordingly. All sources of AGS demand must\nbe controlled through these messages, ensuring that at a minimum, ensuring that all criteria can be enabled and disabled and\ntheir type and demand status determined. It is not necessary for all criteria to satisfy a specific criterion profile by type, and\nproprietary profiles are acceptable.\nA complete test for the support for multiple demand criteria could require a prohibitively time-consuming and complex process,\nand it may not be possible to test all sequences in which AGS criteria can begin and end demand. To enable a reasonably\ncomprehensive test, the product vendor must provide a suitable test sequence. The sequence must be such that all criteria\nsupported by the product appear in at least one test step in which the criterion starts demand when at least one other criterion\nhas demand and subsequently all other demand sources end (thus demonstrating that the criterion can maintain overall\ndemand), and at least one test step in which the criterion ends demand when at least one other criterion has demand (thus\ndemonstrating that the criterion can relinquish control properly.)

There are two forms for the common tests, one for implementations in which the criterion feature is\nintegrated into the primary AGS controller, and one in which the criterion feature is contained in a separate device and\ncommunicates demand as a Network Source. The specific tests are unique for each type. Thus, the full AGS Criterion profile\nconsists of the type-specific tests, plus the base tests for either an integrated implementation or an independent implementation.\nFor clarity in test reporting, the first term in the common tests is left blank here. When reporting test results, this term shall be\nreplaced by the first term in the AGS Criterion profile.\n65B - AGS Base Profile or 65S - Network Demand Source is a prerequisite for all AGS Criterion profiles. 65B is required for\nintegrated implementations, 65S is required for independent AGS demand sources.\n6.35.11.7\nCommon Tests, AGS \u2013 Demand Criterion - Integrated Implementation\nAn AGS Criterion may be implemented either as part of an integrated AGS controller, which reports\nGENERATOR_DEMAND_STATUS, or as a separate device which communicates to the primary controller using the\nGENERATOR_DEMAND_COMMAND with the Network Demand field. This profile applies to the first case.\nAs the criteria are integrated into the same device that reports GENERATOR_DEMAND_STATUS, the profile tests only whether\nthe criterion correctly reports its own status. The AGS Base Profile includes tests to ensure that the genset is actually started\nand/or stopped accordingly.\nThe profile does not place any requirements on the method for configuring the instance and type, and it assumes that the\ninstance and type of all criteria have been configured previous to the tests.\nReporting\nID\nDatum\nTest\nRequired Response\n*-U-01\nAGS_CRITERION_STATUS,\nActive Status\n1.

These DGs assume a system in which some type of sensor is installed at each tire, including possibly those in a\ntrailer or towed vehicle. The sensor reports pressure and/or temperature information along with some sort of identifier.\nThe following formats apply (see Table 6.37.1).\nTable 6.37.1 \u2014 Tire monitoring definition\nDevice attribute\nValue\nCategory\nSensors\nDefault Source Address\n133\nDynamic Address Range\n160 to 175\nInstance\nMulti-instance\nThe receiver may simply report raw sensor data using the TIRE_RAW_STATUS DGN, or with the data indexed to the tire location\nusing the TIRE_STATUS DGs.\nThe RV-C protocol makes no statements about the appropriate frequency of transmissions from the sensors. The TIRE_STATUS\nand TIRE_RAW_STATUS DGs are transmitted immediately whenever sensor data is received. This may mean gaps of several\nminutes, or even much longer if the vehicle is stationary.\n6.37.2\nRaw Tire Status\nIf tire data cannot be correlated with a specific location, then the data should be broadcast with this DGN. Table 6.37.2a defines\nthe DG attributes and Table 6.37.2b defines the signal and parameter attributes. This DG is broadcast only on the reception of\nsensor data.

Although typically these functions are found in cab doors and windows, they may also refer to storage bay doors\nor any network controlled door or window.\nDoor and window placement varies considerably with the make and model of RV. Therefore no instancing scheme can apply\nunambiguously to all situations. However, if appropriate the following guidelines shall be used to assign instances to physical\nlocations in the RV.\nIn a motorized RV with a driver door:\n- The driver door/window shall be assigned Instance 1.\n- The passenger door/window shall be assigned Instance 2.\n- Additional Instances shall be assigned in a clockwise order, starting at the passenger door/window, and incrementing by one.\nThus, in a four-door RV, the driver door is Instance 1, the front passenger door in Instance 2, the right rear door is Instance 3,\nand the left rear door is Instance 4.\nIn a non-motorized RV, or a motorized RV without a driver door:\n- The main entry door/window shall be assigned Instance 1. If there are two entry doors, the door further forward shall be\nInstance 1.\n- Additional Instances shall be assigned in clockwise order, as above.\nCommands broadcast with Instance 0 shall be accepted and carried out by all instances. In this case, only locks and windows\nthat fail to carry out the command are required to send a NAK DGN. All locks shall respond with their status after the command.\nNote that sending a command with Instance zero but no data in the Lock field has the same result as requesting the\nLOCK_STATUS DGN.\nTable 6.40.1 \u2013 Door Lock Control Definition\nDevice Attribute\nValue\nCategory\nMechanical Components\nDefault Source Address\n135 \u2013 Door Controller\n145 \u2013 Window Controller\nDynamic Address Range\n176-191\nInstance\nMultiple\nThe main DGNs associated with a Door Controller are sent only on request. Moreover, these devices are often powered from the\nchassis accessory or ignition circuits, and are therefore often off-line. Therefore it is particularly important that the controller send\na regular status message when on-line to ensure that network devices are aware of its presence.\n6.40.2\nDoor Status\nThe following table (Table 6.40.2a) defines the DG attributes and Table 6.40.2b defines the signal and parameter attributes.\nTable 6.40.2a \u2013 DG Definition\nDG Attribute\nValue\nNovember 6, 2023",

This DGN provides a method of checking the CAN Hi / Lo dominate voltages, the CAN Bus\nImpedance, the communication protocol being used on the network, and Bus Termination / Network Statuses for each network. A\nbridge device may also implement other protocols other than CAN, but only CAN networks have their status reported by this\nmessage.\nEach CAN network is identified with an Instance ranging from 1 to 250. Note that the bridge itself is a non-instanced device.\nThe Remote / Local Network bits in Byte 6 of the message are used as a flag indicating whether or not the CAN Bus Monitoring\npacket is being sent on the same (local) network as the measurements were taken. If needed, this local network flag could be\nused by other CAN devices as a means of determining the network instance number for the network in which they are\nconnected.\nTable 6.43.1a defines the DG attributes and Table 6.43.1b defines the signal and parameter attributes.\nTable 6.43.1a \u2014 DG definition\nDG attribute\nValue\nName\nCAN_BUS_STATUS\nDGN\n1FDE6h\nDefault priority\n6\nMaximum broadcast gap\nNone\nNormal broadcast gap\nOn Request / On Change / 5000ms if an error active\nMinimum broadcast gap\n100 ms\nNumber of frames\n1\nNovember 6, 2023",

For\neach connection made by a broker, the broker assigns a connection\ninstance which is unique only within that broker.  Other brokers may\nuse the same connection instance for their connections.\nFor an external interface, a Broker is a device which connects to the RV-C network and includes an interface to communicate to\ndevices that are not on the RV-C bus.  A Client is a device that connects to a broker via some non-RV-C protocol (e.g. Bluetooth,\nWifi).  An Initiator is the device that starts the connection process; a Responder is a device which responds to the initiator's\nattempts to connect.\nA broker may act in either role - for example, initiating connections to remote sensor devices, while responding to connection\nrequests from cell phones.\nPairing is the attempt to establish a recurring connection; the term may be applied to protocols other than Bluetooth\u00ae.\nTable 6.44b \u2014 Connection Types\nValue Definition\n0\nInvalid\n1\nBluetooth\u00ae LE\n2\nWiFi\u00ae\n3\nThread\u00ae\n4\nBluetooth\u00ae\n5\nEthernet\u00ae\n6\nMODNet\u00ae (DBTech, USPTO 90293345)\n60\nUnspecified Wireless Connection\n61\nUnspecified Wired Connection\n6.44.1\nBroker Status\nTable 6.44.1a \u2014 DG definition\nDG attribute\nValue\nName\nBROKER_STATUS\nDGN\n1FDB6h\nDefault priority\n6\nMaximum broadcast gap\nN/A\nNormal broadcast gap\nOn Change\nMinimum broadcast gap\n100 ms\nNumber of frames\n1\nACK requirements\nNone\nNovember 6, 2023",

The instance numbers for such proprietary alarms should be selected from the range 128-253\n(80h - FDh).\nNote that alarms may duplicate conditions reported by other means. For example, there is a Low Voltage Limit Status defined in\nDC_SOURCE_STATUS_6 (Byte 2, Bits 4-5). In general, alarms should not be defined if they exactly duplicate the previously\ndefined condition. However, there are applications in which it is salutary to inform the user of an impending condition, in which\ncase the use of the alarm is appropriate as it does not precisely duplicate the defined condition.\nAlarms should not duplicate DM-RV SPNs. SPNs indicate that the device is not working properly, and some technical\nintervention is likely required. Generally, alarms indicate devices that are working properly but are in a state that the user should\nbe informed of. Note that, in general, users should have the ability to arm or disarm individual alarms, but they cannot do the\nsame for SPNs.\nSection 7.6 provides a list of standard Alarms.\n6.47.4\nTest Profiles\n6.47.4.1\nGeneric Alarm Base Profile\n(GENERIC_ALARM_STATUS)\nID\nDatum\nTest\nRequired Response\nRequired Behavior\n144A-S-01\nAlarm\nTriggered\nActivate Alarm Trigger\nGENERIC_ALARM_STATUS reports\nAlarm Triggered = 01b (Triggered)\nN/A\nDeactivate Alarm Trigger\nGENERIC_ALARM_STATUS reports\nN/A\nNovember 6, 2023\n6.47.4.1 -  Generic Alarm Base Profile\n\n\u00a9 RVIA\nRV-C\n459\nAlarm Triggered = 00b (Not Triggered)\n6.47.4.2\nGeneric Alarm Acknowledgement Profile\n(GENERIC_ALARM_COMMAND/GENERIC_ALARM_STATUS)\nID\nDatum\nTest\nRequired Response\nRequired Behavior\n144A-C-01\nAcknowledge\nAlarm\nWhile GENERIC_ALARM_STATUS\nAlarm Triggered = 01b (Triggered),\nsend\nGENERIC_ALARM_COMMAND\nAcknowledge Alarm = 01b.\nGENERIC_ALARM_S\nTATUS reports Alarm\nis Acknowledged = 01b\n(Acknowledged)\nN/A\n6.47.4.3\nGeneric Alarm Full-Time Monitoring Required Profile\n(GENERIC_ALARM_STATUS)\nID\nDatum\nTest\nRequired Response\nRequired Behavior\n144A-S-01\nFull-Time\nMonitoring\nRequired\nWhile GENERIC_ALARM_STATUS\nFull-Time Monitoring Required =\n01b (Required), disconnect the\nrequired device from the network or\notherwise silence the\nGENERIC_ALARM_STATUS\nmessage.\nN/A\nMonitoring device notifies the\nuser of the absence of\nGENERIC_ALARM_STATUS\nas an alarm",

However, as capabilities of Batteries evolved, and in the case\nthat multiple batteries are installed, a distinction between the bank of batteries and each individual battery is required as well as\ninsight into an individual Cell level in many cases.\nWithin RV-C a Battery is defined as one or more Cells combined with a monitoring / control device. An example of a Battery is a\nLithium based device with its associated BMS, an AGM device combined with a SOC meter also meets the criteria of a `Battery\u2019\nin the definition of RV-C.\nBATTERY DGs are intended to augment DC_SOURCE providing additional insight into more complex installations \u2013 including\ncell level details, series/parallel connections of Batteries to support the associated DC_SOURCE instance, and even details to\nsupport aggregation of multiple batteries/DC_SOURCEs for use as a virtual device. Unlike DC_SOURCE, BATTERY DGs do not\nhave the concept of \u2018Priority\u2019, and as such unless the monitoring device is dedicated to a given grouping of cells, it should\ntransmit BATTERY messages.\nA battery consists of one or more modules connected in parallel, with each module containing a number of cells. (For the\npurpose of RV-C, a Cell will be defined either as a single physical electro-chemical cell, or a number of such electro-chemical\ncells connected in parallel.). Cells are numbered  within a module beginning with 1 at the lowest voltage point of the module\n(Ground). Each Module within a battery contains the exact same number of Cells. Often a Module consists of a single physical\ncontainer, but if may also consist of a number of series-connected physical containers. In this case cell number will continue\nacross the physical container bearer \u2013 just as if all cells were contained in a common physical container.\nIn the case where the Battery nominal voltage matches that of the associated DC_SOURCE instance nominal voltage (aka, the\nseries string consists of only one battery instance), the Battery management device will directly broadcast relevant DC_SOURCE\nmessages to represent the entire battery. In the case of more than one battery is connected in series (two or more Battery\nInstances associated with a common Series String instance), the individual batteries will coordinate to allow for a single summary\nview to be presented via DC_SOURCE messages. It is up to the battery manufactures to develop this series coordination\nmechanism outside of RV-C.\nBATTERY DGNs are largely not broadcasted, but instead sent on request \u2013 though some may be push at a status change,\nmostly those related with warning and alarm conditions. A Global Request for Battery Summary may be used to survey the entire\nsystem and build a map of batteries, their relationship to each other and their relationships to DC Source Instances.\nCell DGNs are not broadcast in normal operation, and if a device or service tool desires data for individual cells, it shall trigger a\nreport using the BATTERY_COMMAND message; the status of individual cells should be sent only on request. When returning\ncell status, nodes should maintain at least a 25 ms gap between packets to avoid clogging the data bus. This is a slightly smaller\nNovember 6, 2023",

The following DGs provide a consistent method of reporting data from these components and\nconfiguring them, regardless of the sort of device that they are contained in.\nThese DGs are intended primarily for diagnostics and are transmitted only on request. The sole exception is\nDRIVER_STATUS_1, which is also sent on a change in status of the Shutdown Status value. Devices shall maintain a 25ms\nminimum gap between all status messages, rather than the usual 50ms gap.\nIn many cases, the DC driver will correspond with a specific instance of a device such as a Dimmer or DC Load. In other cases\neach instance of a device may have multiple DC drivers. For example, an Awning may have two drivers which form an H-bridge,\nwhile a complicated device such as a Furnace may have several DC drivers with a variety of functions. To accommodate this\nlatter case, each DC driver may have a secondary index. The index is assigned by the device manufacturer, and the protocol\ndoes not attempt to identify the function of each index.\nDevices are allowed to report the same driver under multiple device/instance/index designations. For example, a node may\nreport a driver as both a GENERIC_DC_LOAD, Instance 5, Index 1 and as a AWNING, Instance 1, Index 3. This is appropriate\nfor products that can be configured to have multiple functions (in this example, an awning light) or to make identification easier\nfor a technician. No standard mechanism is provided for identifying these cross-defined drivers.\nThe DGN for each message is structured per table DC Drivers.\nTable 6.50 \u2014 DC Driver DGN Structure\nField\nFunction\nDGN MSB\nMessage type.\nDGN LSB\nDSA of the RV-C device containing the driver.\nData Byte 0\nInstance of the device (per the DSA). For non-instanced devices, always FFh.\nData Byte 1\nIndex. 1-250\n0 is reserved for certain commands to indicate \u201cAll Drivers\u201d\nFFh is acceptable for devices with single driver - e.g. DC Load, DC Dimmer.\nFor example, a generator (DSA 40h) shall report the status of its internal drivers using DGN 16F40h, 16E40h, etc.. Devices shall\nrespond only to requests for DGNs of the same DSA as the device. For example, a generator shall only respond to requests for\nDGNs 16F40h, 16E40h, etc..\nIt is acceptable for devices to implement a \u201cdiagnostic mode\u201d in which status messages are temporarily transmitted on a\nschedule. Devices shall automatically exit the diagnostic mode after a set period of time.\n6.50.1\nDC Component Driver Status 1\nTable 6.50.1a defines the DG attributes, and Table 6.50.1b defines the signal and parameter attributes.\nTable 6.50.1a \u2014 DG definition\nDG attribute\nValue\nNovember 6, 2023",

The scheme is intended to reduce the probability of\nintersecting NMEA 2000 DGNs. New DGNs should be added in sequence, counting down to 1FF80h, then resuming again at\n1FEFFh. At 1FE80h the sequence should again be interrupted and resumed at 1FDFFh. NMEA numbers their DGNs in groups,\nwith each group starting at 1F#00h. Thus unless any NMEA group exceeds 128 DGNs, there is no chance of collision.\nTable 7.7 \u2014 DGN designations\nDGN\nHex\nDecimal\nSection\nDATE_TIME_STATUS\n1FFFF\n131071\n6.4.2\nSET_DATE_TIME_COMMAND\n1FFFE\n131070\n6.4.3\nDC_SOURCE_STATUS_1\n1FFFD\n131069\n6.5.2\nDC_SOURCE_STATUS_2\n1FFFC\n131068\n6.5.3\nDC_SOURCE_STATUS_3\n1FFFB\n131067\n6.5.4\nCOMMUNICATION_STATUS_1\n1FFFA\n131066\n6.6.2\nCOMMUNICATION_STATUS_2\n1FFF9\n131065\n6.6.3\nCOMMUNICATION_STATUS_3\n1FFF8\n131064\n6.6.4\nWATERHEATER_STATUS\n1FFF7\n131063\n6.9.2\nWATERHEATER_COMMAND\n1FFF6\n131062\n6.9.3\nGAS_SENSOR_STATUS\n1FFF5\n131061\n6.10.2\nCHASSIS_MOBILITY_STATUS\n1FFF4\n131060\n6.11.2\nCHASSIS_MOBILITY_COMMAND\n1FFF3\n131059\n6.11.4\nAAS_STATUS\n1FFF0\n131056\n6.12.3\nAAS_COMMAND\n1FFF1\n131057\n6.12.2\nreserved\n1FFF0\n131056\nAAS_SENSOR_STATUS\n1FFEF\n131055\n6.12.4\nLEVELING_CONTROL_COMMAND\n1FFEE\n131054\n6.13.3\nLEVELING_CONTROL_STATUS\n1FFED\n131053\n6.13.2\nLEVELING_JACK_STATUS\n1FFEC\n131052\n6.13.4\nLEVELING_SENSOR_STATUS\n1FFEB\n131051\n6.13.5\nHYDRAULIC_PUMP_STATUS\n1FFEA\n131050\n6.13.6\nLEVELING_AIR_STATUS\n1FFE9\n131049\n6.13.11\nNovember 6, 2023",
