Defines FastAPI APIRouter for managing and interacting with RV-C entities.

This module includes routes for:
- Listing all entities with optional filtering by type or area.
- Retrieving details and history for specific entities.
- Listing unmapped DGN/instance pairs observed on the CAN bus.
- Listing and controlling light entities, both individually and in bulk.
- Providing metadata about available entity types, areas, capabilities, and commands.
